/**
 * Supabase as a database provider.
 *
 * Three facts about Supabase shape everything below, and all three were checked
 * against the published API document rather than assumed:
 *
 *  1. **The password cannot be read back.** There is no GET for a project's
 *     database password — only a PATCH that changes it. So a link asks for it
 *     once and stores it, and `resolveEndpoint` never pretends to know it.
 *  2. **Direct connections are IPv6-only on projects created since 2024**,
 *     unless the account pays for an IPv4 add-on. A default of "direct" would
 *     therefore fail on most new projects with a DNS-shaped error that says
 *     nothing about the cause, so the pooler is the default and direct is an
 *     explicit choice that says why it might not work.
 *  3. **Transaction mode does not support prepared statements.** Our Postgres
 *     driver is `Bun.sql`, which prepares, so transaction mode (port 6543) is
 *     offered but is not the default and says what it costs. Session mode on the
 *     pooler host is the one combination that is both reachable and compatible.
 *
 * The pooler host is NOT derivable from the project ref — it encodes the
 * region — so it is fetched from `/config/database/pooler` at link time and
 * stored on the link.
