/**
 * File Watcher Service
 *
 * Real-time file system watcher using Node's fs.watch (compatible with Bun)
 * Features:
 * - Per-project watcher management
 * - Debounced events to prevent spam
 * - Automatic cleanup on unwatch
 * - Cross-platform support (Windows/Unix)
 *
 * Watching strategy, per platform:
 *
 * macOS and Windows get a single `{ recursive: true }` watch on the project
 * root. Both back it with one OS-level handle (FSEvents / ReadDirectoryChangesW)
 * that covers the whole subtree, so recursion is essentially free and pruning
 * would buy nothing.
 *
 * Linux cannot do that. There, recursion is emulated with inotify and costs one
 * kernel watch per directory, with no way to exclude any of them. A project
 * containing `node_modules` blows past `fs.inotify.max_user_watches`; the
 * watcher faults with ENOSPC, gets rebuilt, and faults again — an endless
 * restart loop that pegged the CPU and, because each restart announced itself as
 * a file change, made clients reload every few seconds with nothing actually
 * changing. So on Linux we walk the tree ourselves and never watch an ignored
 * directory, which removes the overwhelming majority of the watch descriptors.
