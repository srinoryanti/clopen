/**
 * Projector contract.
 *
 * A projection is a row on another surface DERIVED from an account. Surfaces
 * never learn that accounts exist: they keep reading their own tables, and a
 * projector is the only thing that writes an integration-owned row into them.
 *
 * One projector per capability — but ONLY for capabilities whose surface owns a
 * table to write into. `agent-tools` writes an `mcp_servers` row, `database`
 * writes `db_client_connections` ones, `worktree-branching` writes them too —
 * one per live worktree branch, from `worktree_branches` — and `notifications`
 * is registered by the task that builds that surface.
 *
 * TWO CAPABILITIES CAN TARGET THE SAME TABLE, and one account can carry both: a
 * Neon account owns a connection for the project it linked AND one per worktree
 * branch it cut. That works only because migration 077 widened the projection
 * key with `target_id`; releasing by capability alone would tear down the
 * other's rows on every pass.
 *
 * A projector returns a LIST. Agent tools happens to produce exactly one row
 * per account, but that is a fact about MCP presets rather than about
 * projection: one database credential reaches every project the token can see,
 * and the user picks as many of them as they want (see migration 077).
 *
 * `work` and `deployments` deliberately have NO projector. Work items are never copied into the
 * database (see migration 074 for why), so there is no derived row to keep in
 * step — the Issues & PRs surface registers an ADAPTER in
 * `backend/work/registry.ts` and reads the account directly, and Deployments
 * does the same in `backend/deployments/registry.ts`. A capability without a
 * table is a capability without a projection.
