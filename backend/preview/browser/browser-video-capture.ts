/**
 * Browser Video Capture Handler
 *
 * Handles WebCodecs-based video streaming with WebRTC DataChannel transport.
 *
 * Video Architecture (Chrome-Remote-Desktop-style adaptive quality):
 * 1. Frames are captured at the resolution the viewer can actually display
 *    (fit-scale × devicePixelRatio, capped by the host's pixel budget)
 * 2. Capture runs either in-page (getDisplayMedia → VideoFrame, no round-trip)
 *    or via CDP screencast, which is ack-gated so Chrome never rasters a frame
 *    we would discard
 * 3. The page encodes with VideoEncoder — VP9 quantizer mode, H.264 when the
 *    viewer has hardware for it, VP8 as the universal floor
 * 4. When the page goes still, one near-lossless refresh frame is sent so text
 *    sharpens after motion stops
 * 5. Encoded chunks travel over a reliable ordered RTCDataChannel; latency is
 *    bounded by source-side frame dropping, driven by three independent
 *    signals: network buffer, encoder queue, and the viewer's decode queue
 *
 * Audio Architecture:
 * 1. AudioContext interception (handled by BrowserAudioCapture)
 * 2. Audio encoded with AudioEncoder (Opus) in headless browser
 * 3. Encoded chunks sent via sendAudioChunk() to same DataChannel
 *
 * Client:
 * - Receives video + audio chunks via DataChannel
 * - Decodes with VideoDecoder (off the main thread when the browser allows it)
 * - Renders video to canvas, plays audio with proper scheduling

	 * Repair a stream whose PAGE has stopped reporting while someone is watching.
	 *
	 * Recovery used to live entirely in the viewer: it noticed no first frame,
	 * asked for a screencast refresh, then re-handshook. That only works while
	 * the *client's* view of the problem is right — and the failures that stuck
	 * were the ones where the client did everything correctly and the source
	 * was the broken half. Repairing from here closes that gap.
	 *
	 * WHAT COUNTS AS A STALL, AND WHY IT CHANGED
	 *
	 * This used to key on `lastEncodedAt` — frames reaching the encoder — on the
	 * stated assumption that "even an idle page still tops off". That assumption
	 * was wrong, and the bug it caused was severe.
	 *
	 * Capture is damage-driven: `framesAttempted` is only incremented for motion
	 * frames (see `shouldSkipMotionFrame` in scripts/video-stream.ts), and the
	 * still-page top-off is a one-shot that fires after motion stops, not a
	 * heartbeat. So a page that is simply SITTING THERE — the normal case, a user
	 * looking at their app without touching it — reports zero frames forever, and
	 * every one of those reports was read as "the stream is dead".
	 *
	 * The result was a permanent loop on every idle preview: six seconds of
	 * stillness triggered a repair, twelve seconds triggered a FORCED peer
	 * rebuild, which drops every viewer into a re-handshake — the reload with a
	 * progress bar that users saw arrive every few seconds and could not explain.
	 * The rebuild produced a keyframe, which reset the counters, which started
	 * the same clock again. It also made the failure self-sustaining across the
	 * rest of the app: each rebuild is a burst of CDP work plus handshake round
	 * trips on the shared socket, so the busier the instance, the more of them
	 * were in flight at once.
	 *
	 * The honest signal is whether the PAGE is still talking to us, not whether
	 * it has anything to show. Its stats timer ticks every two seconds for as
	 * long as the encoder loop is alive, so silence there — and only there —
	 * means the loop is genuinely gone. A still picture is not a stall.
	 *
	 * The other real failure, an in-page capture that ends on its own, is already
	 * detected explicitly in `applyEncoderStats` rather than inferred from frame
	 * absence, so nothing is lost by no longer guessing here.
