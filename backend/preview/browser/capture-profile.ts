/**
 * Preview Capture Profile
 *
 * Single source of truth for "how much work is this host allowed to do per
 * frame". Every expensive stage of the preview pipeline — Chrome's screencast
 * JPEG encode, the in-page VideoEncoder, the wire, and the viewer's decoder —
 * scales with `pixels × framerate`, so both are budgeted here instead of being
 * hard-coded at each call site.
 *
 * Two independent mechanisms feed into the final capture size:
 *
 * 1. **Display-matched resolution** (`computeCaptureSize`). The preview is
 *    almost always displayed smaller than the emulated viewport (a 1440×900
 *    laptop preview shown in a half-width panel). Capturing at the full
 *    viewport means encoding ~5× more pixels than the screen can show. We
 *    capture at `displayScale × devicePixelRatio` instead, which is exactly
 *    one captured pixel per physical screen pixel — sharper is impossible to
 *    see, so this costs nothing visually. On a Retina display at 50% fit the
 *    factor is 0.5 × 2 = 1.0 and we capture natively, exactly as before.
 *
 * 2. **Host budget** (`getHostCaptureProfile`). A 2-core VPS cannot software-
 *    encode 1080p24 in realtime no matter how large the panel is, so the tier
 *    caps total pixels, framerate, and quality. The runtime ladder in
 *    BrowserVideoCapture adapts within these bounds.
