/**
 * Tool schema for the Memory Graph.

 * One tool, discriminated on `action`, following the Browser Automation server:
 * a registry of actions inside a single tool rather than a dozen sibling tools.
 * That keeps the graph's whole surface in one description the agent reads once,
 * and lets a related pair of steps (recall, then walk a node's neighbours) be
 * decided without another round trip through the tool list.

 * There is no `remember` action, and that is deliberate.
 *
 * Memories are written by ONE path: the automatic extraction that reads each
 * finished turn (`backend/memory/extract/episodic.ts`). A second write path made
 * the store unpredictable — the same fact could arrive either way, phrased
 * differently, at different times, and an agent had no way to know which had
 * already happened.
 *
 * Nothing is lost by removing it. When the user says "remember that I prefer X",
 * extraction reads that sentence in the transcript and stores it, with the same
 * schema and the same duplicate and revision handling as everything else. Asking
 * the agent to also call a tool was asking it to do work the system was already
 * doing, in a way that could disagree with itself.
 *
 * What remains here is what extraction CANNOT do: look things up on demand, walk
 * the graph, and correct what is already stored.
