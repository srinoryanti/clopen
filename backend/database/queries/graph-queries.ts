/**
 * Memory Graph Queries
 *
 * CRUD and traversal for `graph_nodes` / `graph_edges` / `graph_vectors` plus the
 * `graph_nodes_fts` mirror (migration 066). Instance-global and admin-managed —
 * no `user_id` column — mirroring skills / mcp_servers / subagents.
 *
 * Two invariants live here rather than in callers:
 *
 *   1. **Writes upsert on `digest`.** Extraction runs every turn and would
 *      otherwise re-add the same memory endlessly. A repeat write reinforces the
 *      existing node (bumping `weight`) instead of duplicating it.
 *   2. **The FTS mirror is never updated by callers.** Every mutation that
 *      changes indexed text syncs `graph_nodes_fts` in the same transaction, the
 *      way message-queries owns `messages_fts`.
 *
 * Vectors are written separately (see backend/memory/indexer.ts) because they
 * depend on the on-demand embedding artifact, which may not be installed yet.

	 * Edges DERIVED from two memories being about the same subject.
	 *
	 * Removing similarity linking removed almost all of the graph's structure —
	 * 371 edges became 6 — and that was an over-correction with a visible cost: the
	 * view turned into a field of disconnected dots. What was wrong with those 144
	 * edges was never that they connected memories; it was that COSINE decided
	 * which ones. Two memories are related when they are about the same THING, not
	 * when they are phrased alike, and extraction already records what each memory
	 * is about.
	 *
	 * So the relation is stated rather than inferred, and it is derived at READ
	 * time rather than stored: nothing to keep in sync, nothing to repair when a
	 * memory's entities are rewritten, and no way for an edge to outlive the claim
	 * it came from.
	 *
	 * THREE GROUPINGS: a shared subject, a shared FILE, and the same codebase, in
	 * descending order of what they say about two memories. The file grouping is
	 * what the code half used to provide by accident — two memories about
	 * `retrieval.ts` were joined through the file NODE sitting between them — and
	 * migration 076 kept the attribution while dropping the connection. 985 of one
	 * real graph's 2,062 memories share a file with another; none of it was drawn.
	 *
	 * A LARGE GROUP IS DAMPED, NOT DISCARDED, and that correction is why this is
	 * worth reading twice. The rule used to be that a group of more than two dozen
	 * is "a word everyone happens to use" and got dropped outright. Measured on a
	 * real graph the sixteen groups it discarded were `Clopen` (496 members),
	 * `Arga` (299), `wpuploader` (131), `nna-dms-backend` (130) — product and
	 * project names, which is to say the most meaningful lobes the picture could
	 * have had. It threw away 1,627 memberships and left 62% of the graph as
	 * isolated dots, because past a couple of thousand memories every real topic
	 * clears two dozen and only the incidental ones stay small.
	 *
	 * The concern behind the rule was still right: a subject shared by a quarter of
	 * the store does say less about any two of its members. So it is expressed as
	 * WEIGHT — divided by the log of the group's size — which is what Louvain
	 * actually reads. Measured, that is the difference between one lobe of 293 and
	 * a spread of 198/153/144/122/121.
	 *
	 * Degree stays bounded either way, which was always the real protection: each
	 * memory links to a few of the strongest members rather than to all of them,
	 * and a large group links to fewer still. A clique of thirteen is seventy-eight
	 * lines saying one thing; bounded degree says the same thing, keeps the cluster
	 * visible, and stays linear as the graph grows.
