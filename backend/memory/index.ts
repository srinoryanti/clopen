/**
 * Memory Graph — public surface.
 *
 * One store of what past work established — decisions, patterns, failures,
 * preferences — shared by every engine, so an agent can ask "what did we decide
 * about X" whatever is driving the session. Each memory carries the files it
 * claims something about, which is what ages it when they change and what an
 * anchored query seeds from (migrations 066 and 076).
 *
 * Layout:
 *   embedding/     local static-embedding model, installed on demand
 *   retrieval.ts   BM25 + vector + graph expansion, fused with RRF
 *   indexer.ts     backfills vectors behind writes
 *   extract/       turns each finished turn into memories
 *   compose.ts     the hand-written path: free text in, reviewed memory out
 *   context.ts     token-budgeted injection at turn start
 *   time.ts        reads SQLite timestamps as the UTC they actually are
 *   redact.ts      keeps credentials out of durable storage
 *   revise.ts      belief revision — duplicates, supersession, entities, feedback
 *   invalidate.ts  ages memories whose code changed underneath them
 *   consolidate.ts compresses clusters of memories into generalisations
 *   retention.ts   the bound on how large the graph may grow
 *   maintenance.ts runs the background jobs when nobody is working
