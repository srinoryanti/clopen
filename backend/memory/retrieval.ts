/**
 * Hybrid retrieval over the Memory Graph.
 *
 * Three signals, combined on **every** query — this is not a fallback chain:
 *
 *   1. **Lexical (BM25 over FTS5)** finds identifiers, paths and error names.
 *      Embeddings are weakest exactly here, because a rare symbol like
 *      `EngineNotReadyError` has no semantic neighbourhood to sit in.
 *   2. **Vector (local static embeddings)** finds paraphrase and cross-language
 *      matches — an Indonesian question reaching an English memory with no shared
 *      word. BM25 is blind to that.
 *   3. **Graph expansion** pulls in what the direct matches are connected to,
 *      which is the whole point of storing memory as a graph: the best answer is
 *      often adjacent to the match rather than the match itself.
 *
 * The two ranked lists are merged with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. RRF is used
 * instead of blending raw scores because BM25 and cosine are not comparable
 * quantities — one is unbounded and corpus-relative, the other is bounded — so
 * any weighted sum of the two would need per-corpus calibration to mean
 * anything. Ranks need none.
 *
 * A conditional "use vectors only if lexical found nothing" design was
 * considered and rejected: identical queries would take different code paths as
 * the corpus grew, making results feel arbitrary. Both channels always run;
 * whichever has signal contributes it. What DOES vary is how much each is
 * trusted — see `profileQuery`.
 *
 * No LLM is involved and no network call is made. Target is well under 30 ms so
 * this can run on every turn.
