/**
 * Retrieval evaluation harness.
 *
 * Every constant in the ranker was tuned against a measurement that was taken
 * once, by hand, and then thrown away: the RRF damping, the minimum token count
 * for a vector, the z-threshold for linking, the channel weights. That is fine
 * for arriving at a number and useless for keeping it. The next change to any of
 * them — and there will be many, because ranking is never finished — has nothing
 * to check itself against.
 *
 * So the golden set lives here. It is small on purpose: a fixture that takes ten
 * minutes to run gets skipped, and thirty queries over forty memories is enough
 * to catch a regression that matters. What it asserts is a FLOOR, not an exact
 * ordering — ranking legitimately shifts when the corpus or the weights change,
 * and a test that pins the precise order would fail on every improvement as
 * readily as on every regression.
 *
 * The vector channel needs the on-demand artifact. Without it the harness still
 * runs and asserts the lexical floor, which is lower and stated separately —
 * being honest about the degraded mode is the point of measuring it.
