/**
 * Graph view assembly for the visualization.
 *
 * ── What this file is NOT allowed to do any more ─────────────────────────────
 * It used to run Louvain on every call. Community detection is stable per
 * dataset, so opening the modal, changing a filter, or any conversation
 * recording a memory made every connected client pay for the same clustering
 * again — and the cost grew with the store rather than with what was on screen.
 * It now lives in `graph_layout`, written by the background pass in `layout.ts`,
 * and this file only reads it.
 *
 * ── Showing everything, at bounded cost ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The old view answered scale with a cap: return the three thousand most
 * reinforced memories and set `truncated`. That is not a scale strategy, it is a
 * silent ceiling — past it the rest of the store simply was not in the picture,
 * with no way to reach it but narrowing a filter.
 *
 * The answer here is to aggregate by POSITION rather than to trim by rank, and
 * the difference is what the user sees. Grouping by community — the obvious
 * alternative, and the first thing tried — replaces the picture: you get lobes
 * instead of memories, and reaching any memory means opening one first. Grouping
 * by position keeps the picture. The layout plane is divided into a grid fine
 * enough that the number of OCCUPIED cells is bounded, and each occupied cell
 * becomes one mark. Marks merge only where their dots would have overlapped
 * anyway, so the silhouette, the lobes and the colours are the ones the full
 * graph would have drawn, and nothing is missing from it.
 *
 * Below `RENDER_BUDGET` no cell holds more than one memory, so every mark IS a
 * memory and the view is exactly the flat one it always was. Above it, a cell
 * holding one memory still returns that memory — fidelity is lost only where
 * the display had none to give.
 *
 * Zooming into a mark asks for its cell as a rectangle, which costs that
 * rectangle rather than the store.
