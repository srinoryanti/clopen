/**
 * When episodic extraction runs, and what happens when it does not.
 *
 * ── why it no longer waits ──
 * Extraction calls a model through the SAME engine the user is chatting with, so
 * on a shared-process engine that request competes with the next chat turn. That
 * used to buy six seconds of enforced quiet before a summary could start.
 *
 * The trade was priced wrong. What the delay bought was a slightly shorter queue;
 * what it cost was that a memory did not exist until six seconds after the turn
 * that produced it — an agent could not read back what had just been established,
 * the graph visibly lagged the conversation it was meant to be following, and a
 * session where the user kept typing deferred its own extraction indefinitely.
 * Waiting to avoid a queue is only worth it when somebody is waiting on the
 * queue, and nobody is waiting on this one.
 *
 * So a finished turn is summarised NOW. The only thing that still holds it back
 * is an ACTIVE stream — a summary generated mid-answer competes with the answer —
 * and even that is bounded by MAX_DEFER_SECONDS, so a session that never goes
 * quiet is summarised anyway instead of accumulating a span longer than the
 * transcript budget can carry.
 *
 * ── why the queue is a TABLE ──
 * It used to be a `Map` in this module, which lost a turn's memories silently in
 * three different ways: a failed model call was caught, logged and dropped with no
 * second attempt; a restart discarded everything parked; and none of it was
 * visible, so memory simply did not grow and the only explanation was in the
 * server log. Extraction is the sole write path for the whole feature, which makes
 * "it failed once and gave up" an unusually expensive default.
 *
 * Now it is `memory_extraction_queue` (migration 066). A failure schedules a
 * retry with exponential backoff, exhausting the attempts marks the row FAILED
 * rather than deleting it, and startup puts failed rows back — because the usual
 * causes (no model configured, an expired account, an engine that was down) are
 * exactly the kind of thing that a restart means someone has just changed.
 *
 * ── what is banked ──
 * ONE ROW PER SESSION, holding the OLDEST turn boundary not yet summarised. The
 * transcript runs from that message to the end of the chain, so one extraction
 * covers every turn since. Keeping the newest, as the original did, silently
 * discarded everything in between.
 *
 * That merge now has a race to answer for, because extraction runs immediately: a
 * turn can finish while the previous one is still being read, and it merges into
 * the row already in flight. The runner therefore claims a REVISION and its
 * delete is conditional on it, so the merged-in turn is never thrown away with
 * the one that succeeded.
 *
 * Invalidation is NOT queued — it reads the disk diff, touches no model, costs
 * one indexed lookup, and a memory standing on code that just moved should say so
 * before the next turn rather than after the next extraction.
