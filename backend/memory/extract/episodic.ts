/**
 * Episodic extraction — turning a finished turn into durable memory.
 *
 * This is the one part of the Memory Graph that calls a model, and it is placed
 * where that cost is invisible: after the turn has finished streaming, off the
 * render path, with nothing waiting on the result. A slow extraction delays only
 * when a memory becomes searchable, never when the user sees their answer.
 *
 * Because it is the only model call in the system, it does THREE jobs rather than
 * one, all from the same transcript and the same request:
 *
 *   1. **Extract** what the turn established that is worth keeping.
 *   2. **Revise** — decide whether each new memory replaces something the graph
 *      already holds, or merely restates it. This needs a reader of the turn;
 *      cosine can tell that two memories are about the same thing but not which
 *      of them is currently true.
 *   3. **Adjudicate** the memories that were injected INTO this turn: which
 *      actually helped, which were wrong. That is the only evidence in the whole
 *      system about whether a memory is any good, and it exists for free here
 *      because the turn that consumed them is exactly what is being read.
 *
 * What it looks at is the transcript of the turn plus which files changed on
 * disk. Reading the transcript rather than only the diff is the point — a diff
 * shows what changed, but the reason it changed, the approach that failed first,
 * and the preference the user stated along the way exist only in the
 * conversation.
 *
 * Everything is written in English regardless of the chat's language. That keeps
 * the corpus in one language so embeddings compare cleanly and the same claim
 * made in two languages de-duplicates instead of becoming two nodes. The
 * repository already requires English for durable text, so this follows suit.

	return `You keep a long-term memory. Read one span of a work session and write down everything stated in it that would still be worth knowing weeks from now, in a different session, to someone with no other context.

WRITE EVERY MEMORY IN ENGLISH, both label and body. The conversation below is usually in another language; translate as you record it. A corpus in mixed languages neither compares nor de-duplicates, so the same fact stated once in each language becomes two unrelated entries that never connect.

THE TEST IS WHETHER IT COULD BE READ BACK OUT OF THE REPOSITORY.

An agent in a later session can open the code, the config and the lockfile in seconds. Anything it would find there is not worth a memory, however true. What it can NEVER recover that way is what happened in the conversation: why a choice was made and what was rejected, what the user asked for and objected to, what was tried and failed, and the conventions people follow that the code merely reflects.

WRITE DOWN:
- decisions and the reasoning behind them, including the option that was not taken
- preferences and corrections the user stated
- failures: what broke, why, and what fixed it
- conventions and constraints that hold beyond the file they were noticed in
- who someone is, and how they work
- behaviour of a language, runtime, framework or library that surprised someone

DO NOT WRITE DOWN:
- what the project is built with, unless the turn explains WHY it was chosen. "The project uses Prisma with PostgreSQL" is in package.json
- a feature inventory of the codebase — payments, auth, localization, uploads. Listing the directory answers that faster than recalling it
- a blow-by-blow account of what the agent did (that is history, not knowledge)
- a restatement of the code diff
- something true only for this one turn, with no bearing on later ones
- content-free pleasantries ("thanks", "ok", "continue")
- credentials, tokens, keys or anything else secret, even in passing

A turn that only ANSWERED A QUESTION about existing code has usually established nothing durable, and returning an empty list is the right answer far more often than it feels like. A memory that merely describes the code costs recall budget on every future turn and tells the reader what it could have looked up.

PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO CORRECTIONS. When the user says a version of "no, not like that", "don't do X", "I'd rather you Y", that is the single highest-value thing in the transcript: it is a preference stated explicitly, it usually generalises beyond this turn, and it is the kind of thing that gets re-litigated every session until someone writes it down. Record it as a preference with high confidence, phrased as the rule rather than as the incident.

PREFER FEWER, LARGER MEMORIES. If a turn establishes one thing, write ONE. Five notes saying a marketplace takes payments, has referrals, uses OTP and compiles SCSS are one fact about one project split five ways, competing with each other for the same slot forever.

How to write each one:
- English. Not the language of the conversation. Check this before returning.
- The label must stand alone, with the subject named. "Arga is a full-stack developer working in JavaScript and TypeScript", not "the user introduced themselves". "Sessions are rejected once the auth token expires", not "fixed the bug".
- Pick the closest subkind. entity = who or what something is. preference = how someone wants things done. decision = a choice and its reason. pattern = a convention that holds. failure = something that broke and why. observation = anything else durable.
- scope "global" = true beyond this codebase (people, preferences, cross-project conventions). scope "project" = true of this codebase only.
- relatedPaths must be paths that appear below; never invent one. Most memories have none.
- entities names the people, tools or systems the memory is about, so statements about the same subject are stored together.

WRITE IT SO IT TRAVELS. When the turn establishes something about a language, a runtime, a library or a way of working, state the RULE rather than the incident: "In Svelte 5 a multi-statement derived block must use $derived.by", not "fixed the total showing a function". The rule is useful in another project six months from now; the incident is not. When the turn establishes something about this codebase in particular, say which codebase it is about.

RELATING TO WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN
Each of your memories may be compared against the neighbours listed under EXISTING MEMORIES. For every neighbour that is either the SAME claim or the OPPOSITE claim, add an entry to relations. Judge the claim, not the wording.
- same — it says what you are saying, in other words. The existing memory is reinforced instead of a near-copy being stored.
- opposite — it cannot be true at the same time as yours. Both are kept; the system decides which is current each time it is asked, using who said it and how recently.
- Everything else you may leave out.

Do not try to decide which of two conflicting memories should win, and do not withhold a memory because it disagrees with something stored. Recording the disagreement IS the answer.

EXISTING MEMORIES:
${options.related}

MEMORIES GIVEN TO THIS TURN:
${options.injected}
For each of those, return a verdict in feedback. "ignored" is the ordinary answer and carries no criticism — most memories offered to a turn simply do not bear on it. Reserve "wrong" for one the transcript actually shows to be incorrect.

Files changed on disk during this span:
${files}

Transcript:
${options.transcript}`;

 * Ask the configured model for structured memories, relations and verdicts.

 * Two things here are not incidental.
 *
 * IT RUNS IN A NEUTRAL DIRECTORY, not the user's repository. Engines implement
 * `generateStructured` by opening one of their own sessions in `projectPath`, so
 * the repository's instruction files land in the model's context alongside the
 * transcript — and it writes them down. Measured: a span whose entire content was
 * "halo, nama saya Arga" produced "Arga is the user working on the Clopen
 * project", and another produced "Clopen uses Bun as the exclusive runtime —
 * Node.js and Deno are not supported", a sentence lifted from the repository's
 * CLAUDE.md that nobody in the conversation had said. It also made the call less
 * reliable: pointed at a repository, 3 of 12 runs failed outright (truncated
 * JSON, or the model answering about the directory instead of the task) against
 * 1 of 12 from an empty directory. Extraction is a text transformation; giving it
 * a codebase to look at can only contaminate it.
 *
 * IT HAS A DEADLINE. This is the only write path in the feature and it had no
 * timeout of its own, on top of a `drain()` loop with no deadline either — so one
 * hung call froze recording AND stood maintenance down until the process was
 * restarted, silently. Observed in testing: a single call that had not returned
 * after thirty-five minutes.
