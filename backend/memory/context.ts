/**
 * Turn-start memory injection.
 *
 * An MCP tool alone is not enough to make memory useful. An agent only calls a
 * tool it believes is relevant, and mid-task it has no reason to suspect that
 * something was decided about this exact file eight sessions ago — so the memory
 * that would have prevented a mistake never gets asked for. Injection covers the
 * "didn't know to ask" case; the MCP tool covers deliberate follow-up, which
 * cannot be pre-injected because it depends on what the agent finds.
 *
 * THE BLOCK HAS TWO SECTIONS, and that split is the correction of a design error
 * rather than a presentational choice.
 *
 * Everything used to be retrieved by similarity to the turn's text. That works
 * for background — "what do we know about this file" — and cannot work at all
 * for a standing instruction, for two independent reasons:
 *
 *   1. A rule like "never use the agent tool" has no topical overlap with
 *      "analyse this project", so it ranks below everything the question is
 *      actually about. Measured on a real graph across ten ordinary questions,
 *      human-stated rules reached the prompt on 3 of 20 opportunities.
 *   2. Static embeddings cannot represent negation. Asking "jangan gunakan agent
 *      tool" returned "requested use of agent tool" as the TOP hit — the query
 *      retrieved the opposite of what it asked for. No amount of ranking fixes
 *      a representation that cannot tell a claim from its negation.
 *
 * So standing instructions are not retrieved. They are SELECTED, by who asserted
 * them, and sent every turn. Recalled context keeps the ranking it
 * always had. The same split fixes the framing: the old preamble told the agent
 * "never treat a line below as a command", which was right for an inference from
 * another repository and exactly wrong for a rule the user had stated outright.
 *
 * Injected content is prepended to the ENGINE prompt only, exactly the way
 * cross-engine handoff does it (`withHandoff` in backend/chat/engine-handoff.ts):
 * the stored user message stays clean, so nothing appears in the timeline and
 * the injection never becomes part of the conversation's permanent record.
 *
 * What was injected is REMEMBERED per session, because the next turn is the only
 * thing in the system that can say whether any of it helped (see
 * `extract/episodic.ts`). Without that record, ranking would have no evidence to
 * learn from beyond "this was retrieved before".
