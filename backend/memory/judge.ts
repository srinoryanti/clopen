/**
 * The two judgements the graph makes about itself on a timer, both of which used
 * to be made by a cosine threshold and neither of which a similarity score can
 * answer.
 *
 *   1. **Are these two memories the same claim?** Measured against the shipped
 *      artifact on labelled pairs: same-claim pairs score 0.63–0.77, opposite
 *      pairs 0.70–0.99, unrelated-but-similar pairs up to 0.92. Every genuine
 *      duplicate scores below the median opposite, because a mean-pooled static
 *      embedding has no representation for negation — "prefers to use the agent
 *      tool" against "prefers NOT to use the agent tool" scores 0.9938. The same
 *      pairs put to a model: 11 of 12 correct on the harder three-way question,
 *      against 6 of 12 for cosine on the easier two-way one.
 *
 *   2. **Would this memory help someone on a different project?** Nothing tried
 *      to answer this before; `project_id` was doing double duty as provenance
 *      and as a fence, so a Svelte reactivity gotcha debugged in one repository
 *      was invisible in every other. Measured: a model answers it correctly 15
 *      times in 16, with zero errors in the damaging direction (a codebase fact
 *      wrongly released to travel).
 *
 * Both run on the maintenance timer, never on a path anyone waits on, using the
 * same configured model as extraction. Both are bounded per pass. Both fail
 * closed: a model that cannot be reached leaves the graph exactly as it was.
