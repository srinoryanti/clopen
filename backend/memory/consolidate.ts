/**
 * Consolidation — compressing many small memories into fewer large ones.
 *
 * A graph of four hundred observations is less intelligent than a graph of forty
 * principles with four hundred observations hanging under them, even though it
 * contains strictly more text. Retrieval has a fixed budget: eighteen hits, a
 * few thousand characters. Spending that budget on eight variations of one idea
 * is the difference between an agent that knows how this project works and one
 * that gets eight anecdotes.
 *
 * So the graph periodically does what a person does overnight: takes a cluster of
 * related memories and writes down what they have in common. The children are not
 * deleted — they are archived and joined to the summary with `generalizes`, so
 * the evidence for a generalisation is always one hop away and a wrong summary
 * can be undone.
 *
 * This also IS the retention policy for episodic memory. Growth is bounded by
 * compression rather than by deletion, which is the only bound that does not
 * throw information away.
 *
 * It runs on a maintenance timer, never on a path anyone waits on, and it uses
 * the same configured model as extraction. Clusters come from the Louvain
 * communities already computed for the graph view, so the grouping the user sees
 * as coloured lobes is the grouping that gets consolidated.
