/**
 * Belief revision: keeping the graph's opinion of itself up to date.
 *
 * Migration 066 gave memory a place to accumulate. Accumulation alone produces a
 * landfill — the decision made in March and the decision that reversed it in
 * August both sit there, both get retrieved, and the agent re-adjudicates them
 * on every single turn. The schema has carried `supersedes` and `contradicts`
 * since the beginning and nothing ever wrote one.
 *
 * The judgement is made by the model that is ALREADY summarising the turn. That
 * is the design constraint that makes this affordable: extraction is handed the
 * memories the graph already holds about this topic, with their ids, and returns
 * `supersedes` / `duplicateOf` alongside the new memories. No second model call,
 * and the adjudication is better informed than a separate pass would be, because
 * it happens with the transcript in view.
 *
 * Three mechanisms, applied in order of confidence:
 *
 *   1. **Exact identity** (`digest`) — the same claim, same words. Handled by
 *      the upsert in graph-queries; reinforces, never duplicates.
 *   2. **Semantic near-duplicate** (cosine, here) — the same claim, different
 *      words. This is the one that decides whether the graph is still usable
 *      after six months, because a model rephrases the same fact every time it
 *      sees it and exact identity catches none of that.
 *   3. **Contradiction** (the model, here) — a DIFFERENT claim about the same
 *      thing. Only a reader of the turn can tell this from a near-duplicate.

/**
 * Cosine floor for CANDIDATE GENERATION — not for deciding anything.
 *
 * The threshold this replaces tried to answer "are these the same claim" with a
 * similarity score, and the measurements say no score can. Against the shipped
 * artifact, on labelled pairs:
 *
 *   same claim, reworded      0.63 – 0.77
 *   opposite claim            0.70 – 0.99
 *   different claim           0.11 – 0.92
 *
 * Every genuine duplicate scores BELOW the median opposite. "User prefers to use
 * the agent tool" against "…prefers not to use the agent tool" scores 0.9938,
 * because a mean-pooled static embedding has no representation for negation;
 * "Run bun run check after coding" against "Run bun run lint after coding" scores
 * 0.9202 while making two different claims. On the real graph the shipped 0.85
 * rule matched 2 pairs out of 5,356 — and one of those two was a wrong merge —
 * while five near-identical copies of "Arga is a full-stack developer" sat at
 * 0.76 and were kept, filling the recall budget for months.
 *
 * The same twelve pairs put to the extraction model: 11 of 12 correct on the
 * harder THREE-way question, against 6 of 12 for cosine on the easier two-way
 * one. So cosine keeps the job it is good at — pulling a handful of plausible
 * neighbours out of thousands — and the model, which is already being called to
 * summarise the turn, makes the call.

 * in 84 repositories, 115 of 208 episodic nodes were entity stubs with an empty
 * body, and `about` pointed at a stub 220 times against 6 times at a file — so
 * the graph was not "memories about code", it was "memories about the names of
 * technologies". They duplicated on spelling ("Myria Labs" / "MyriaLabs",
 * "Express" / "Express.js", "Vue" / "Vue 3"). And an empty body is below
 * `MIN_TOKENS_FOR_VECTOR`, so a stub could never be found semantically while
 * still being offered to the model to adjudicate against — which produced a
 * `contradicts` edge between a real memory and the bare string "ClickTrainer
 * Platform". A name is not a claim; it cannot agree or disagree with one.
 *
 * As a row in `graph_node_entities` joined into the FTS text, "what do we know
 * about Bun" is an index lookup that returns the memories directly, instead of a
 * hop through a hub whose forty edges made it contribute almost nothing anyway
 * (see `SPREAD_DAMPING` in retrieval.ts).
