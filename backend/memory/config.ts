/**
 * Memory Graph configuration.
 *
 * Split across two settings screens on purpose, mirroring how Artifacts works:
 * the MODEL lives in Settings → Model → Memory next to the other model choices,
 * and the BEHAVIOUR lives in Settings → Infrastructure → Memory. They answer different questions
 * ("which model writes memories" vs "what should memory do"), and putting them
 * on one page made both harder to find.
 *
 * The model only runs episodic extraction, after a turn has finished streaming
 * and once the session has gone quiet (see `extract/scheduler.ts`). Nothing a
 * user waits on calls a model: retrieval is BM25 plus a local lookup table plus
 * SQL. That is why a slow model is acceptable here and would not be on the read
 * path.

/**
 * THERE IS NO "HOW MUCH TO RECALL" SETTING, and its absence is deliberate.
 *
 * It was a character budget first, which did not bound what it claimed to —
 * measured, its lowest setting produced a block 79% over the number chosen, and
 * its highest silently undershot because the corpus ran out. Replacing it with a
 * count of memories fixed the arithmetic and left the real problem: relevance is
 * not uniform across turns. Six is too many for "ok, continue" and too few for a
 * turn that touches a subject the graph knows a great deal about, and no fixed
 * number can be right for both.
 *
 * The block now takes hits while they are still close to the best one for THAT
 * query and stops when they fall away (see `RELATIVE_FLOOR` in context.ts), so
 * the count follows the question. A hard ceiling remains, in code, as a cost
 * backstop rather than as a control anyone is asked to reason about.
