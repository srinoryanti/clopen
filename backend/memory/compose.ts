/**
 * Writing a memory by hand.
 *
 * Automatic extraction has a hard limit that no amount of tuning removes: it can
 * only record what a conversation happened to state. A constraint the user
 * already knows — "never touch the vendored directory", "staging is on the old
 * schema until March", "this client insists on tabs" — has to be said to an
 * agent before it can be remembered, which means the mistake it would have
 * prevented has usually already happened once. This is the way in that does not
 * require staging a conversation to say something out loud.
 *
 * ── one field, then a review ──
 * The input is one free-text box, because the alternative is a six-field form
 * for a store whose whole promise is that you do not have to curate it. But what
 * gets stored IS six fields, and letting a model fill the other five without
 * showing its work would mean a graph whose contents nobody had read. So the
 * write is two steps: shape it, show it, then save what was shown. The preview
 * is editable, and the user can decline the shaping entirely.
 *
 * ── and it never depends on a model ──
 * `structure: false` — or a missing/failing memory model — falls back to
 * splitting the text into a heading and a body. That fallback is not a
 * degradation to apologise for; it is what makes this the one part of memory
 * that works on an instance with no model configured at all, which is exactly
 * the instance whose graph is otherwise empty.
