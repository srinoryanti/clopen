/**
 * Budgeted staged-diff builder for the AI generators.
 *
 * The commit-message and branch-name handlers used to inline the raw output of
 * `git diff --cached` into the prompt. That has no upper bound: a lockfile
 * refresh or a vendored bundle turns one "generate commit message" click into
 * hundreds of thousands of tokens, and on strict-context models it fails
 * outright instead of degrading.
 *
 * This builds the same information under a hard budget: the `--stat` header
 * always survives (it is small and describes the *whole* change), noisy paths
 * are skipped by name, and the patch body is filled file by file until the
 * budget runs out. Truncation is announced in the text so the model knows it is
 * looking at a sample rather than the complete change.
