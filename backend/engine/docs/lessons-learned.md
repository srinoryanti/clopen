## 10. Lessons learned — pitfalls when authoring a new adapter

These notes come from building the `copilot` adapter. Each item has been
gotten wrong at least once — keep this mental checklist in your head when
writing the next adapter.

### 10.1 Both tool name **and** tool input must be canonicalised

`toCanonicalToolName()` only guarantees the tool name does not become
`Unknown:*`. That is **not enough**: tool UI components (`Bash`, `Read`,
`Edit`, …) read specific fields (`command`, `filePath`, `oldString`, …).
Other SDKs use `snake_case` (`file_path`, `old_str`) or even bundle
multiple subcommands under a single name (e.g. Copilot's
`str_replace_editor` → split into `view`/`create`/`str_replace`/`edit`/`insert`).

The pattern used in `copilot/message-converter.ts`:

```ts
// 1. Map raw name → canonical UI name (snake → PascalCase + dispatch subcommand).
const COPILOT_TOOL_NAME_MAP: Record<string, string> = { 'bash': 'Bash', ... };
function mapCopilotToolName(rawName, mcpServerName) { ... }

// 2. Per-tool normaliser: takes Record<string, unknown>, returns canonical shape.
function normalizeReadInput(raw): ReadInput {
  // path → filePath, view_range:[s,e] → offset/limit, etc.
}

// 3. Dispatcher called from buildToolUseBlock.
function normalizeCopilotToolInput(canonical, raw) {
  switch (canonical) { case 'Read': return normalizeReadInput(raw); ... }
}
```

If only the name mapping is done, the UI still picks the right component
but the fields are `undefined` → the user sees an empty block. Always
install **both** layers.

### 10.2 Filter the SDK's "harness tools"

Some SDKs emit internal tools used for model↔harness coordination that
**must not** appear in chat (intent reporting, task-completion markers,
internal documentation). Examples from Copilot CLI: `report_intent`,
`task_complete`, `propose_work`, `fetch_copilot_cli_documentation`.

Strategy: filter at the adapter boundary, do not render `Unknown:*`. See
`copilot/message-converter.ts::IGNORED_COPILOT_TOOLS` +
`isIgnoredCopilotTool()`. Drop **both sides**: the tool_use (in
`convertAssistantMessage`) **and** the tool_result that arrives later (in
`convertToolComplete`) — if you only drop one side, the UI either gets an
orphan result without a tool or an orphan tool without a result.

### 10.3 One `tool_use` per `AssistantMessage`

The convention used by Claude and OpenCode: each assistant message that
reaches the frontend has **at most one** `tool_use` block. SDKs like
Copilot CLI may send a single `assistant.message` with many `toolRequests`
— the adapter must split it.

Pattern:
```ts
const blocks: AssistantContentBlock[] = [];
if (data.content) blocks.push({ type: 'text', text: data.content });
for (const req of visibleToolRequests) blocks.push(buildToolUseBlock(req));

const messages = blocks.map((block, idx) => ({
  type: 'assistant',
  messageId: blocks.length === 1 ? baseId : `${baseId}:${idx}`,
  content: [block],   // one block per message
  ...
}));
```

If violated, the frontend `message-grouper` still works but Compact mode
and the tool layout do not stitch correctly.

### 10.4 Buffer messages until the usage event arrives

In many SDKs (Copilot included), `assistant.usage` is a **separate** event
that arrives **after** `assistant.message` for the same turn iteration.
If the adapter yields the message immediately, the `usage` field is
always `null` in the DB and in the token-cost dashboard.

Buffering pattern in `copilot/message-converter.ts`:

```ts
// State:
pendingMessages: UnifiedAssistantMessage[];
lastUsage: AssistantUsageData | null;

// convertAssistantMessage: push to pending, return what was already flushed.
state.pendingMessages.push(...messages);
return flushPending(state);   // flush old queue, leave the new ones waiting

// captureUsage: attach to the last pending, then flush.
state.pendingMessages.at(-1)!.usage = mapUsage(data);
return flushPending(state);

// flushPending also has a fallback: if a pending message still has
// usage == null but state.lastUsage is set, fill it in. This covers
// turns where the SDK emits assistant.message after assistant.usage,
// or tool-only iterations whose usage event landed earlier.
//
// Defensive flush at tool.execution_complete, turn_end, session.idle —
// preserve ordering even when the SDK sends events out of order.
```

The `lastUsage` state is also kept around to build the aggregate
`ResultEvent` at `session.idle` — that is the **per-stream** usage, not
per-message.

### 10.5 `tool_use.result: null` is **expected** before render

When inspecting raw adapter output (e.g. logs or DB rows before render),
`tool_use` blocks always carry `result: null`. That is **correct**: the
tool_result arrives as a synthetic `UserMessage` with `toolUseId`. The
frontend `message-grouper.ts` (via `processToolMessage` + `toolUseMap`)
attaches it at display time.

Do not try to perform that stitching in the adapter — if you do, the
`stream-manager` loses the chance to persist the tool_result as its own
DB row, and resume-session breaks.

**Sharp edge — `parent.toolUseId` MUST be null on the synthetic
UserMessage.** The toolCallId belongs only on the inner `tool_result`
block, never on the message-level `parent.toolUseId`. The frontend
grouper interprets any user message with `parent.toolUseId !== null` as
a **sub-agent message** (i.e. one emitted from inside an `Agent` /
`Task` tool execution): if the parent id matches an Agent tool it goes
into the sub-agent activity bucket, otherwise it is silently dropped.
Setting `parent.toolUseId = data.toolCallId` therefore makes the
tool_result invisible to the UI and `tool_use.result` stays null after
render.

```ts
// ✅ correct — top-level tool_result (Claude, OpenCode, Copilot)
parent: { messageId: null, sessionId: null, toolUseId: null }

// ❌ wrong — frontend grouper drops this as a "sub-agent" message
parent: { messageId: null, sessionId: null, toolUseId: data.toolCallId }
```

Only set `parent.toolUseId` when the message is genuinely a child of an
`Agent` / `Task` tool execution (e.g. the OpenCode Task adapter passes
`parentToolUseId` through `convertToolResultOnly`). For raw
`tool.execution_complete` events at the top of the loop, leave it null.

### 10.6 Enable the SDK's streaming flag explicitly

Some SDKs default to emitting only the final message. For delta/partial
streaming you must set the SDK-specific flag:

- Copilot: `streaming: true` in `SessionConfig` & `ResumeSessionConfig`.
- OpenCode: `partial: true` in chat options.
- Claude: `includePartialMessages: true` (already on by default in
  `ClaudeCodeEngine.streamQuery`).

Without the flag, the UI shows text "all at once" — the symptom is
identical to an adapter that forgot to emit `StreamLifecycleEvent` /
`TextDeltaEvent`, so check the flag first before debugging the converter.

### 10.7 Pair `start`/`stop` lifecycle for reasoning

The frontend stream-manager renders reasoning in a separate bubble
**only** while `StreamLifecycleEvent { reasoning: true, event: 'start' }`
is open. Always emit `stop` when reasoning ends (or when assistant text
begins — the two are mutually exclusive in the UI). See
`copilot/message-converter.ts::convertReasoningDelta`, which flushes the
text stream before opening the reasoning stream.

### 10.8 Event-order debug workflow

If chat output looks weird, log the raw `SessionEvent` per stream before
the converter. The canonical Copilot order is:

```
session.start
assistant.turn_start
[assistant.reasoning_delta...]    assistant.reasoning
[assistant.message_delta...]      assistant.message     assistant.usage
                                                        tool.execution_start
                                                        tool.execution_complete
[loop back to reasoning/message for the next turn iteration]
assistant.turn_end
session.idle
```

From here it is easy to trace: if `usage` is always null, buffering is
wrong. If you see orphan tool_results, the ignored-tools filter is not
consistent on both sides. If text appears all at once, the SDK streaming
flag is off.

### 10.9 Per-stream account override when the SDK takes the credential at construction

Most SDKs accept env vars per-call (Claude) or read them from the
subprocess environment (OpenCode). The Copilot SDK is different: the
GitHub token is passed to `new CopilotClient({ gitHubToken })` at
construction time and cannot be swapped on the fly.

Pattern in `copilot/stream.ts`:

```ts
private currentAccountId: number | null = null;

async initialize(accountId?: number): Promise<void> {
  if (this._isInitialized && (accountId == null || accountId === this.currentAccountId)) {
    return;   // already initialised with this account → no-op
  }
  const account = accountId != null
    ? engineQueries.getAccount(accountId)
    : engineQueries.getActiveAccountForEngine('copilot');
  this.client = new CopilotClient({ gitHubToken: account.credential, ... });
  this.currentAccountId = account.id;
  ...
}

async *streamQuery(options) {
  // Per-stream account override: dispose + re-init when it differs.
  if (this._isInitialized && options.accountId != null
      && options.accountId !== this.currentAccountId) {
    await this.dispose();
  }
  if (!this._isInitialized) await this.initialize(options.accountId);
  ...
}
```

The frontend wiring is shared with Claude (single-account-list engines —
see §6.2): both stores expose the same API, so `EngineModelPicker.svelte`
uses one derived `accountsForEngine` and one dropdown. To add a fourth
adapter that follows this same pattern, just add a branch in the four
derived values and the `$effect` blocks; do not duplicate the dropdown.

If you forget the per-stream override path, the chat input appears to
honour the account picker but the engine actually streams against the
last initialised credential — silently using the wrong PAT/quota.

### 10.10 Fork session — native API vs. on-disk workaround

The multi-branch checkpoints feature requires that **every** resume
spawn a fresh session id, so the engine continues from that point
**without** mutating the original session's history. Each adapter wires
it differently, but the contract is the same: fork unconditionally on
resume.

| Adapter   | How                                                                                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Claude    | Pass `forkSession: true` in the SDK options on every call — native.                          |
| OpenCode  | Call `client.session.fork({ path: { id: resume } })` on every resume — native.               |
| Copilot   | Call `client.rpc.sessions.fork({ sessionId: resume })` on every resume — native (added in `@github/copilot-sdk` 1.0.0-beta.4; still marked `@experimental` in 1.0.9, so keep the fallback-to-plain-resume path). |
| Codex     | **No native API yet** — fork by copying the rollout JSONL FILE on every resume.              |
| Qwen Code | **No native API yet** — fork by copying the chat JSONL FILE on every resume.                 |
| Pi        | `SessionManager.forkFrom()` on the on-disk JSONL tree (in Clopen's isolated sessions dir) — native, on every resume. |
| Cline     | **No session store at all** (stateless `Agent`) — the adapter reconstructs branch history in memory and forks by copy. See "In-process, session-less SDKs" below. |

> **Sharp edge — fork is NOT gated on `EngineQueryOptions.forkSession`.**
> The `forkSession` field exists on the type but the stream-manager

The two remaining on-disk workarounds (Codex and Qwen) follow the same
shape — copy the state, replace the source id with a fresh one, then
resume against the fork — but the SDKs lay state out differently. Get
the layout wrong and `sessionStateExists()` silently returns false on
every turn, the fork block is skipped, and the engine resumes the
original session — exactly the symptom multi-branch checkpoints
surface as.

**Codex — single rollout JSONL in a date-tree.** The thread id is in
the filename, not a directory name:

```
<CODEX_HOME>/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/rollout-<TIMESTAMP>-<thread_id>.jsonl
```

where `<CODEX_HOME>` is Clopen's isolated `{clopenDir}/engine/codex/user/` (§10.19),
**not** `~/.codex` — the helper reads it via `getCodexHomeDir()`, so it
tracks the isolated dir automatically.

The fork helper walks the date-tree to find the source by
`-<thread_id>.jsonl` suffix, copies it into TODAY's `YYYY/MM/DD` dir
under a new `rollout-<now>-<forkId>.jsonl` filename, and replaces every
occurrence of the source id (UUIDs don't collide with other content in
the file). Earlier versions of `codex/session-fork.ts` mistakenly
assumed a directory layout (`<CODEX_HOME>/sessions/<thread_id>/`) — the
result was a permanently-broken fork because `sessionStateExists()`
never matched. If you change the helper, watch for that regression.

**Qwen Code — single chat JSONL keyed by sanitised cwd.** The chat id
is the filename basename; the parent directory is derived from the
project's cwd via the SDK's `sanitizeCwd()`
(`cwd.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '-')`, lowercased on win32):

```
<QWEN_RUNTIME_DIR>/projects/<sanitized-cwd>/chats/<sessionId>.jsonl
```

where `<QWEN_RUNTIME_DIR>` is Clopen's isolated `{clopenDir}/engine/qwen/user/`
(§10.19), **not** `~/.qwen` — both the env var and the fork helper
(`getQwenRuntimeDir()`) resolve to the same base, so they stay in sync.

Every record line carries a `sessionId` field equal to the file's
basename. The fork helper copies the file to
`<chats>/<forkId>.jsonl` in the same project directory and replaces
the source id throughout. The Qwen `session-fork.ts` therefore takes
`projectPath` as an extra argument — Codex and Copilot are
cwd-agnostic because their layouts aren't keyed on it.

```ts
// stream.ts (resume path) — fork on EVERY resume; pattern is identical
// across copilot/codex/qwen, only the helper signature differs.
let resumeId = resume;
if (resume && sessionStateExists(/* projectPath if qwen, */ resume)) {
  const forkId = crypto.randomUUID();
  if (forkXxxSessionState(/* projectPath if qwen, */ resume, forkId)) {
    resumeId = forkId;
  }
}
// then pass resumeId to the SDK's resume entry point.
```

The expected effect, observable by logging the session/thread id per
turn:

```
turn 1   user → assistant   sessionId: A
turn 2   user → assistant   sessionId: B   (forked from A)
turn 3   user → assistant   sessionId: C   (forked from B)
```

Every assistant message carries its **own** session id. Reusing the
same id across turns is the symptom that forking is gated or skipped.

**In-process, session-less SDKs (Cline) — copy-on-branch in memory.**
Some SDKs expose only a stateless run loop (`@cline/sdk`'s `Agent`) with
**no** host-owned session store — nothing on disk, nothing keyed by a
session id. The adapter reconstructs branch history itself, and the fork
contract is unchanged: **every turn mints a fresh session id and stores its
resulting transcript under that new id; a resumed turn restores the parent
id's transcript and NEVER overwrites it.** Because each conversation node
then owns a unique id, `resume` (= the branch point's `parent.sessionId`,
derived by the stream-manager) selects exactly one ancestor, so sibling
forks (A→B→C vs A→B1→C1) stay isolated.

```ts
// cline/stream.ts — resume path
const priorMessages = resume ? this.sessions.get(resume) : undefined;
const sessionId = crypto.randomUUID();               // ALWAYS new — never reuse `resume`
// … agent.restore(priorMessages) + agent.continue(userMsg), or agent.run() when fresh …
this.sessions.set(sessionId, [...result.messages]);  // store under the NEW id; do NOT mutate the parent entry
```

The trap that produced the classic checkpoint bug during Cline bring-up:
keying the transcript by an id that's **reused** across turns
(`sessionId = resume ?? uuid`, then `sessions.set(resume, …)`) overwrites
the one shared entry — so after an undo+continue the forked branch restores
the **sibling** branch's tail and answers with the wrong history. The tell
is identical to the on-disk case: **every persisted assistant message shares
one session id.** Bound the map (FIFO) so a long-lived project engine can't
grow unbounded — evicting an old entry only degrades a *very* old fork to
"no context", the same graceful fallback as a cross-restart resume (the
in-memory map is empty after a restart, so `resume` misses and the turn
starts fresh). This is the one real limitation of the session-less approach,
and it's unavoidable: adapters **must not** read the message DB themselves
(§2.5), so cross-restart branch context can't be rebuilt.

When an SDK eventually adds a native `forkSession` (or equivalent), the
migration is a one-liner: delete that adapter's `session-fork.ts`, drop
the fork block in `stream.ts`, and pass the SDK flag the same way
Claude, OpenCode, and Copilot already do. The `// TODO` comment at the
top of each `session-fork.ts` pins the migration target.

### 10.11 Reset `currentAccountId` in `dispose()`

Whenever you track per-init state on the engine (e.g.
`currentAccountId`, cached models, the SDK client itself), reset every
field in `dispose()`. A half-disposed engine that still reports
`isInitialized = false` but holds a stale `currentAccountId` will short-
circuit the next `initialize(accountId)` call and reuse the wrong
credential.

```ts
async dispose(): Promise<void> {
  await this.cancel();
  if (this.client) await this.client.stop();
  this.client = null;
  this.modelsCache = null;
  this.currentAccountId = null;     // ← do not forget
  this._isInitialized = false;
}
```

### 10.12 Reuse the existing MCP HTTP infrastructure — never build a new bridge

`backend/mcp/internal/remote-server.ts` already mounts every server registered via
`defineServer()` as a **Streamable HTTP MCP** endpoint at
`http://localhost:<port>/mcp`. OpenCode consumes it via
`getOpenCodeMcpConfig()`. Tool handlers run **in-process** in the Clopen
backend — there is no subprocess, no per-engine HTTP listener, no
per-stream MCP path. Project context propagates via
`projectContextService` (AsyncLocalStorage with a `mostRecentActiveStream`
fallback when the transport doesn't preserve the context).

When you add an engine whose CLI/SDK accepts a streamable-http MCP URL
(e.g. Codex, Copilot):

1. Add a sibling helper next to `getOpenCodeMcpConfig()` —
   `getXxxMcpConfig()` — that returns the **same** URL in the engine's
   expected shape (Codex format: `{ '<server-name>': { url: '...' } }`;
   Copilot format: `{ '<server-name>': { type: 'http', url: '...', tools: [...] } }`).
   The engine sees every enabled MCP server (`browser-automation`,
   `weather-service`, …) as one logical MCP server namespace exposing all
   the tools.

   **Naming conventions for the helper** (mirror the existing two so the
   reviewer doesn't ping you twice):
   - Use the SDK's **exported type** for the return shape if one exists
     — e.g. Open Code's `McpRemoteConfig` from `@opencode-ai/sdk`,
     Copilot's `MCPHTTPServerConfig` from `@github/copilot-sdk`. Only
     define a local type alias when the SDK doesn't export one (Codex).
   - Reuse the `'clopen-mcp'` namespace key. Don't invent a new one
     per engine — the tool-name resolver below depends on it.
   - In the adapter, name the local variable holding the helper's return
     value **`mcpConfig`**, not `mcpServers`. The latter shadows both the
     SDK's config field name AND the registry exported from
     `backend/mcp/internal/config.ts`, and reads as a bug at the call site.

2. Use `resolveOpenCodeToolName()` (in `backend/mcp/internal/config.ts`) on
   incoming tool names; it strips the `clopen-mcp_` / `clopen-mcp-`
   prefix and reverse-maps to `mcp__<server>__<tool>`. The same helper
   works for any engine that uses the same naming convention.

   **Engines DO NOT agree on the prefix separator.** Open Code joins the
   server-config key to the tool name with `_` (`clopen-mcp_open_new_tab`);
   Copilot joins with `-` (`clopen-mcp-open_new_tab`); Codex emits a bare
   tool name and carries the server name separately on the event payload.
   `resolveOpenCodeToolName()` strips **both** `clopen-mcp_` and
   `clopen-mcp-` prefixes for this reason. If a new engine introduces yet
   another separator, extend the prefix list in that helper — do **not**
   add a parallel resolver in the adapter.

   The symptom of skipping this step is a tool that renders in the UI
   with the doubled-up name `mcp__clopen-mcp__clopen-mcp-<tool>` instead
   of `mcp__<server>__<tool>` — the prefix didn't strip and the registry
   lookup fell through to the `mcp__<mcpServerName>__<rawName>` fallback.

3. If your engine has **no callback hook** for AskUserQuestion (Codex's
   SDK is the canonical example), AskUserQuestion stays unsupported for
   that engine until the upstream SDK exposes a native primitive. The
   previous engine-agnostic MCP fallback (`ask-user-question` tool +
   stream-keyed pending registry) was removed once the carrying cost —
   AsyncLocalStorage plumbing, dual resolve paths in
   `backend/ws/chat/stream.ts`, manual cancel-aborts — outweighed the
   benefit. Wire the engine's native hook to `resolveUserAnswer` when it
   ships; do not reintroduce a parallel MCP path.

4. Auto-approval of MCP tool calls is **per-engine**, not centralised.
   Each SDK exposes its own approval surface and they are not
   interchangeable:
   - Claude Code: `canUseTool` returns `{ behavior: 'allow' }` for all
     non-AskUserQuestion tools (already handled by the adapter).
   - Open Code: replies `'once'` to `permission.asked` events at runtime
     via `autoApprovePermission()`.
   - Codex: enumerates every enabled tool with `approval_mode: 'approve'`
     in the per-server config — `codex exec` is non-interactive and has
     no runtime approval channel, so the decision must be baked in
     up-front.
   - Copilot: `onPermissionRequest: approveAll` covers MCP tools
     too — no per-tool enumeration needed.

   Wire whichever path exists; do not assume Codex-style enumeration is
   required when a runtime hook is available, and do not assume runtime
   approval works when only static config is offered.

What you must NOT do:
- ❌ A second HTTP listener (e.g. "MCP HTTP bridge for Codex"). Reuse `/mcp`.
- ❌ Per-engine MCP servers in `backend/mcp/servers/` (e.g. one folder
  per engine). All MCP servers are engine-agnostic and registered via
  `defineServer()` once.
- ❌ Per-stream bearer tokens or unique URLs. Authorization piggy-backs
  on `projectContextService` exactly like the Claude in-process path.
- ❌ A new namespace key in `getXxxMcpConfig()` (e.g. `'copilot-mcp'`).
  Always use `'clopen-mcp'` — `resolveOpenCodeToolName()` keys off it.
- ❌ A local type alias when the SDK exports the type (Open Code,
  Copilot). Import `McpRemoteConfig` / `MCPHTTPServerConfig` directly.

### 10.13 Auth-blob swap into a shared CLI dotfile (vs. **per-account** isolated dirs)

> **Scope:** this section is about multiple accounts *within* Clopen. The
> orthogonal question — keeping Clopen's whole footprint out of the user's
> global `~/.codex` / `~/.copilot` — is **§10.19**, and there the answer is
> the opposite: we DO override the home env var, but with **one dir per
> engine shared by all accounts**, not one per account.

When a CLI hard-codes its credential location (Codex reads
`<CODEX_HOME>/auth.json`; Gemini CLI reads `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`;
etc.), the naïve approach is to give **each Clopen account** its own
isolated home directory and override the CLI's home env var
(`CODEX_HOME=/foo/account-1/`, `/foo/account-2/`, …). **Don't.** A
*per-account* split has bitten us:

- Session/thread state lives in the same dir tree (`<CODEX_HOME>/sessions/`,
  `<CODEX_HOME>/projects/`), so a per-account split fragments session
  memory and breaks fork-by-copy across accounts.
- Token refresh happens in-place in the dotfile — refreshes performed
  under account A's dir don't reach account B.

Instead, all Clopen accounts for an engine share the **single** isolated
home from §10.19, and multi-account is handled by swapping the one dotfile
inside it to/from the DB:

| Step | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Login** | Spawn the CLI's login command (`codex login`, etc.) — run with the isolated home env var set (e.g. `CODEX_HOME`) so it writes the dotfile inside `{clopenDir}/engine/{engine}/user/`, not `~`. On success, **read the dotfile content** and persist it to `engine_accounts.credential` as a JSON wrapper, e.g. `{ kind: 'chatgpt', authJson: '<file content>' }`. |
| **Switch account** | `accounts-switch` handler reads the chosen account's `credential`, parses the wrapper, writes `authJson` **back to the shared dotfile** with an atomic replace (`write to .tmp` + `rename`). |
| **Stream-start** | Adapter ensures the dotfile reflects the right blob (re-write if drift detected; cheap idempotent op). |
| **Stream-end** | Read the dotfile back and snapshot it into the active account's `credential` so any token refresh the CLI performed during the turn survives across switches. |

Trade-off: only **one** Codex/CLI account is "active" on disk at a
time. Concurrent streams from two different accounts will race; UI must
surface only one active account per engine and document the limitation.
For Clopen, that matches existing UI assumptions. If a future engine
genuinely needs concurrent multi-account streams, escalate the trade-off
explicitly — do **not** silently switch to per-account home dirs.

Concurrency caveat: if the login command itself writes to the shared
dotfile (Codex's `codex login` does), serialize the login flows with a
backend-wide mutex so two simultaneous "Add Account" attempts can't
clobber each other.

### 10.14 Long-lived server engines need a "Restart Server" UX

If your engine boots a process or constructs an SDK client that **caches
credentials** beyond a single stream (OpenCode's `opencode serve`
subprocess, Copilot's `CopilotClient` constructor), then add / remove /
switch account does NOT take effect until that cached state is rebuilt.
The fix is the **Restart-Server pattern** documented in §4.2:

1. Add a `*-server-restart` WS event with the standard contract: check
   active streams, return `{ needsConfirmation, activeChats }` when not
   forced; on `force === true`, cancel streams + dispose engine + drop
   any cached subprocess/client; the next `streamQuery` lazy-inits fresh.
2. Surface a **"Restart Server"** button in **two** UI places:
   - **Settings → Engines** — visible after add/remove/switch in the
     engines settings panel itself. Confirmation dialog for non-forced.
   - **Chat Input** — visible next to the model/account picker when the
     user has switched account mid-session. Uses `force: true` so the
     send-flow stays inline. See `EngineModelPicker.svelte::ocNeedsRestart`
     for the flag and `restartOCServer` for the handler.
3. After a successful restart, refresh the model catalog
   (`modelStore.refreshModels(engineType)`) since model availability can
   depend on credential state.

Engines that **do not** need this:

- Subprocess-per-turn engines (Claude Code's `query()`, Codex's
  `codex exec`) re-read credentials at every turn — there is nothing
  cached to invalidate.
- Engines using the auth-blob swap pattern (§10.13) — the swap happens
  inside `accounts-switch`, and the next turn's subprocess picks up the
  new dotfile without a restart event.

If you are tempted to add a `*-server-restart` event for an engine that
spawns a fresh subprocess per turn, you almost certainly want the
auth-blob swap (§10.13) instead — adding the restart event ships dead
code and confuses the UX (button that does nothing observable).

### 10.15 Parent-tool activity (`Task` / `Agent` / `Workflow`) — route before render

Every engine SDK we support exposes a "dispatch sub-agent" tool. Each
SDK names it differently (Claude → `Task`, OpenCode → `task`, Copilot →
`task`) and emits the sub-agent's tool calls / messages on the **same
event stream** as the main turn. Without explicit routing those nested
messages render as orphan top-level rows in the UI, and the dispatch
tool itself appears as `Unknown:task`. There are three independent
fixes — miss any one and the symptom shows up in the UI.

**1. Canonicalise the dispatch tool name to `Agent`.** Every adapter
must map its native name into the unified `Agent` block so the frontend
tool renderer (`handleAgentTool`) and `subAgentMap` lookups work:

```ts
// claude/message-converter.ts
const name = block.name === 'Task' ? 'Agent' : block.name;

// opencode + copilot tool-name maps
'task': 'Agent',
```

Then normalise the SDK's raw input fields into `AgentInput { prompt,
description, subagentType }` (see §10.1). Field names vary —
`prompt`/`task`/`instruction`, `agent_type`/`subagent_type`/`agent` —
so the normaliser must accept them all and default `subagentType` to
`'general-purpose'`.

**2. Stamp `parent.toolUseId` on every sub-agent message.** The
frontend grouper (`message-grouper.ts`) routes messages with
`parent.toolUseId !== null` into `subAgentMap[parentToolId]` and
attaches them as `subActivities` on the parent `Agent` tool block.
Top-level messages must keep `parent.toolUseId = null` (see §10.5);
sub-agent messages must carry the **parent dispatch tool's** call id.
Each SDK exposes that linkage differently:

| Engine   | How the parent id is discovered                                  |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Claude   | `msg.parent_tool_use_id` is on every nested SDK message          |
| OpenCode | `convertToolUseOnly` / `convertToolResultOnly` / `convertSubtaskToolUseOnly` take a `parentToolUseId` parameter; the caller threads it through when iterating the subtask part |
| Copilot  | `subagent.started` event carries `data.toolCallId` (parent) and `agentId` (child instance). The converter records `agentParentMap[agentId] = data.toolCallId` and `resolveParentToolUseId(event, state)` resolves later events: `data.parentToolCallId` first (deprecated direct hint), else map lookup by `agentId` |

The converter functions for assistant messages, reasoning messages and
`tool.execution_complete` then accept an optional `parentToolUseId` and
stamp it onto `parent: { ..., toolUseId: parentToolUseId ?? null }`.
On `subagent.completed` / `subagent.failed`, delete the map entry so
the next sub-agent dispatch re-registers cleanly.

**3. Suppress the SDK's sub-agent streaming deltas.** Some SDKs
double-emit sub-agent activity: once as live text/reasoning deltas
inside the main stream, and again as final non-streaming
`assistant.message` / `assistant.reasoning` / `tool.execution_complete`
events scoped to the sub-agent. The deltas have no clean parent
linkage and would leak into the main chat bubble. The fix is to disable
streaming for sub-agents at the SDK config level so only the final
bundled events arrive — those carry `agentId` and route correctly via
step 2 above:

```ts
// copilot/stream.ts — baseConfig
includeSubAgentStreamingEvents: false,
```

If your SDK has no equivalent flag, the fallback is client-side: in the
event switch, `if (parentToolUseId) break` for any
`assistant.turn_start` / text-delta / reasoning-delta lifecycle event,
since those lifecycles belong to the sub-agent and would corrupt the
main turn's stream state.

**Cross-engine consistency.** Once all three fixes are in place, the
frontend treats the three engines identically: the `Agent` block in the
main timeline carries `subActivities`, no orphan top-level messages
appear, and the dispatch tool's name renders as `Agent`. If only step 1
ships, sub-agent tool calls float to the top of the chat. If only step
2 ships, the dispatch tool still says `Unknown:task`. If only step 3 is
missed (in an SDK that does double-emit), sub-agent text appears in
both places.

**Session-less SDKs with no native sub-agent primitive (Pi, Cline) —
synthesize the `Agent` tool yourself.** The above assumes the SDK *has* a
`Task`/`Agent` tool that emits nested messages. A bare run loop
(`@cline/sdk`'s `Agent`, Pi's `AgentSession`) has none — the "Available
Subagents" preamble is then informational only and the model has nothing
to call (the exact symptom reported on Cline: *"it never uses subagents"*).
Expose a synthetic `Agent` tool (`createTool`) whose description lists the
enabled subagents; its `execute` spawns a **fresh, bounded sub-agent** with
the chosen subagent's system prompt + the permission-filtered builtins
**ONLY** (no AskUserQuestion, no MCP, no nested `Agent` — delegation must
not recurse), runs the delegated prompt to completion, and returns the
sub-agent's `outputText` as the tool result. Three things to get right —
each was a separate round-trip during Cline bring-up:

1. **Actually register the tool.** When subagents are enabled, push the
   `Agent` tool into the tools list **and** set
   `toolPolicies.Agent = { autoApprove: true }` (+ include it in the
   `system_init` tool list). Missing this = the model can't delegate
   because the tool isn't there. Skip the whole block when no subagents
   are enabled — there's nothing to dispatch to.

2. **Route sub-activities via a late-bound queue handle.** The dispatch
   `run()` is constructed *before* the stream's `EventQueue` exists, so
   hold a `{ queue: null }` box and set `.queue` right after the queue is
   created. Inside `run()`, subscribe to the sub-agent, convert its
   events with the same message-converter, stamp
   `parent.toolUseId = context.toolCallId` (the parent `Agent` block's id)
   on each message, and push into that queue. The frontend folds them under
   the `Agent` block as `subActivities` (step 2 above). Miss this and
   `subActivities` stays empty even though the delegation ran.

3. **Sub-activities are a tool trail — push tool_use only.**
   `processSubAgentMessages` renders both `tool_use` **and** `text`
   activities, but the convention (Claude/Pi) is tool-only: the sub-agent's
   prose is already the `Agent` tool's *result* (`outputText`). Push only
   assistant messages that contain a `tool_use` block, plus their
   `tool_result` user messages; drop text-only assistants, reasoning, and
   every transient event. Miss this and the sub-agent's narration leaks in
   as `text` sub-activities (the second Cline round-trip).

Because the sub-agent is a **separate instance**, its internal steps never
enter the main agent's transcript — the parent only ever sees the `Agent`
call + its returned text. So sub-agent work can't contaminate the parent
conversation, nor a later checkpoint fork of it (§10.10). See
`cline/agent-tool.ts` + the dispatch block in `cline/stream.ts` (and the
Pi equivalents) for the reference implementation.

**File-backed background tools (`Workflow`) need a push bridge, not a timer.**
Claude's `Workflow` differs from `Task`: the SDK stream contains the Workflow
tool call and launch result, but child agents append their conversations to
`agent-*.jsonl` files under the reported transcript directory. Waiting for the
next SDK heartbeat batches unrelated records together; polling every N
milliseconds merely hides that defect and adds guessed latency.

The reference implementation is
`claude/workflow-transcript.ts` + the merge queue in `claude/stream.ts`:

1. Observe the complete `Workflow` tool call and launch result, then register
   the transcript directory against that exact tool call id.
2. Watch the transcript and run-status directories with filesystem change
   events. A file create/append wakes the producer immediately.
3. Read only complete newline-delimited records after each file's saved byte
   offset. Coalesced filesystem notifications are harmless because the file,
   not the notification count, is the source of truth.
4. Convert visible child messages and stamp the Workflow id onto
   `parent.toolUseId` before pushing them into the merged `EventQueue`.
5. Preserve each transcript record's timestamp. Assigning `new Date()` while
   draining makes a batch look simultaneous and destroys useful ordering.
6. Continue watching after the main SDK iterator ends. The background process
   can still be writing; close only after the run status is terminal, perform
   a final drain, and dispose every watcher in `finally`.

Do not display a Workflow as *running* from a partial `tool_use` start event.
At that point its JSON input/script is incomplete and execution has not begun.
The valid empty-`subActivities` state starts when the complete parent tool call
is emitted; subsequent filesystem events populate it.

**Frontend invariant: a child may never claim a root placeholder.**
`chat.service.ts::handleMessageEvent` replaces a transient text placeholder
only for assistant messages whose `parent.toolUseId` is null. A child assistant
must be pushed intact so `message-grouper.ts` folds it into the parent's
`subActivities` in the same reactive pass. If the handler replaces a root
placeholder indiscriminately, every nested tool flashes at root and then
appears to move under its parent even though the database relation was correct
from the beginning.

Regression checks for any new parent tool should prove all of the following:

- the parent is emitted before children and initially accepts an empty activity list;
- every child has the correct parent id on its first emitted shape;
- source notifications wake the side-channel producer without a timer;
- repeated/coalesced notifications do not duplicate records;
- SDK completion does not truncate a still-running background producer;
- no parent-tagged assistant replaces a root streaming placeholder.

### 10.16 `generateStructured` — schema strictness & part-extraction fallback

`generateStructured` powers three one-shot JSON callers: the AI
commit-message generator, the branch-name generator, and artifact
authoring (Skills/Commands/Subagents/Instructions from a purpose). Each
adapter satisfies the same `StructuredGenerationOptions → Promise<T>`
contract, but the SDKs split sharply on whether they accept a schema
natively:

| Engine       | Strategy        | Mechanism                                                    |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Claude       | Native          | `outputFormat: { type: 'json_schema', schema }` on `query()` |
| Codex        | Native (strict) | `Thread.run(prompt, { outputSchema })` → `Turn.finalResponse`|
| OpenCode     | Prompt          | `client.session.prompt({ tools: {}, … })`, parse text/reasoning parts |
| Copilot      | Prompt          | `createSession({ availableTools: [], streaming: false })` + `sendAndWait` |
| Qwen         | Prompt          | `query({ coreTools: [], maxSessionTurns: 1 })`, read `SDKResultMessageSuccess.result` |
| Pi           | Prompt          | tool-less in-memory `createAgentSession`, parse final assistant text |
| Cline        | Prompt          | tool-less `Agent`, parse final assistant text                |
| Cursor       | Prompt          | `Agent.send(buildJsonPrompt(...))` → `run.wait().result` (local agents always carry the built-in tools, so the prompt is the only lever) |

**Test on a prompt-engineered engine.** Three of the four bugs in this
section only reproduce off the native path. Claude Code is the worst
possible smoke test for `generateStructured`.

**Two cross-cutting gotchas you will hit.**

**1. OpenAI strict mode demands a fully-closed schema.** Codex (via the
Responses API) rejects any object that omits `additionalProperties:
false` (`invalid_request_error / invalid_json_schema`) and requires
every property to appear in `required`. Optional fields must be
expressed as nullable type unions, not absent from `required`:

```ts
// backend/ws/git/commit-message.ts — shape that satisfies Codex.
{
  type: 'object',
  additionalProperties: false,
  required: ['type', 'scope', 'subject', 'body'],
  properties: {
    type:    { type: 'string', enum: [...] },
    scope:   { type: ['string', 'null'] },   // was just 'string'
    subject: { type: 'string' },
    body:    { type: ['string', 'null'] },
  },
}
```

This is the **lowest common denominator** — Claude, OpenCode, Copilot,
and Qwen all accept the same shape, so authoring all
`generateStructured` schemas to Codex's rules keeps the call site
engine-agnostic. Don't lift constraints into the adapter; lift the
schema in the caller.

The consumer of the parsed JSON must then handle `null` for any field
that used to be "absent" — the existing falsy guards in
`commit-message.ts` (`result.scope ? …`, `result.body ? …`) already do
that. The corresponding TS type in `shared/types/git.ts` mirrors this
(`scope: string | null`).

**2. Prompt-engineered engines can return empty `text` parts.** OpenCode
in particular emits `reasoning` parts in addition to `text` parts, and
on some thinking-heavy models the JSON answer lands in the reasoning
stream while `text` is empty. The early implementation that filtered
only `p.type === 'text'` raised "OpenCode returned no text content" in
that case.

Two defences, both in `backend/engine/structured-helpers.ts` and the
OpenCode adapter:

- **Fall back across part types.** `text` first, then `reasoning`.
  Filter out `ignored`/`synthetic` parts so the SDK's own scratch text
  doesn't leak into the JSON parser. Log the part-type breakdown in the
  error message so the next failure is diagnosable.
- **Extract JSON tolerantly.** `extractJson()` tries, in order: every
  ` ```json ` fenced block, every top-level balanced `{ … }`, a greedy
  first-brace-to-last-brace slice, then the raw trimmed text — parsing
  each one twice, the second time with control characters inside string
  literals escaped. Models routinely ignore the "no markdown fences"
  instruction; the parser should not.

  Two failure modes justify the balanced scan and the repair pass, and
  both are covered by `structured-helpers.test.ts`:

  - **Trailing commentary.** A model that emits the object and then adds
    "Let me know if you want changes!" produces JSC's
    `Unable to parse JSON string` (its message for *valid JSON followed
    by anything*), and the old first-`{`-to-last-`}` slice broke too
    whenever that commentary contained a brace. Brace counting must be
    string-aware or a `}` inside a value closes the object early.
  - **Raw newlines in string values.** JSON forbids a literal newline
    inside a string, but any field holding Markdown (an artifact body, a
    commit body) attracts them — which is why artifact generation broke
    on models that git commit generation, with its short single-line
    fields, never tripped.

  A truncated response still throws rather than half-parsing: a draft
  missing half its body is worse than a clear failure. The error preview
  shows both ends of the text so truncation and trailing prose are
  distinguishable from the log alone.

The native engines (Claude, Codex) skip these — Claude exposes
`structured_output` on the `result` message and Codex's
`Turn.finalResponse` is already the JSON string. They only fall through
to `extractJson` defensively against the (rare) `finalResponse` arriving
fenced.

**Cancellation.** Every adapter accepts `options.abortController` and
hands its `signal` to whatever the SDK exposes (Codex
`TurnOptions.signal`, Claude `Options.abortController`, OpenCode `prompt
{ signal }`, Copilot `session.abort()`, Qwen `QueryOptions.abortController`).
The contract is the same as `streamQuery`: aborting cancels the in-flight
request, not just the await.

**3. Never trust a caller-supplied `providerSlug`.** The adapters split
again on whether they read it at all: Claude, Codex, Qwen, Copilot, and
Cursor key off `modelId` alone, while OpenCode passes it as
`model.providerID` and Pi/Cline resolve their account by it. A client
that persists engine/provider/model as separate fields and updates only
some of them therefore fails on exactly three engines and silently
"works" on the other five — which is how a `commitGenerator.provider`
stuck at its `'anthropic'` seed surfaced as `OpenCode returned empty
response` while Claude Code was fine.

The engine catalog is the only source of truth for which provider (and
account) a model belongs to, so every `generateStructured` call site
routes through `resolveGenerationTarget(engine, modelId, providerHint)`
in `backend/engine/resolve-model.ts` first. It reads the registry
(filled by `models:list`, fetching the catalog only on a miss), returns
the catalog's provider, and throws a "pick it again in Settings →
Models" error when the model belongs to no provider the engine offers.
It also forwards the model's `accountId` when the catalog carries a real
one — today every adapter reports `account.id: 0` (account is a separate
per-chat dimension, and these routes have no account picker), so engines
keep falling back to their active account. New engines are covered
without touching a call site; do not reintroduce `providerSlug:
data.providerSlug`.

**Engine-not-implemented errors.** `backend/ws/git/commit-message.ts`
guards on `engine.generateStructured` — if you add an engine that can't
implement structured output, leave the property `undefined` and the WS
route will surface `Engine "<name>" does not support structured
generation` cleanly.

### 10.17 OpenCode SDK v1 vs v2 — events come from the binary, not the npm types

`@opencode-ai/sdk` ships **two** API surfaces: the root entry (`.` →
`dist/index.js`, the **v1** client the adapter uses today) and a separate
**v2** entry (`@opencode-ai/sdk/v2`). Across the 1.4 → 1.15 jump the v1
*typed* `Event` union was trimmed — `question.asked`, `message.part.delta`,
and `permission.asked` no longer appear in `dist/gen/types.gen.d.ts`; the
typed equivalents (`EventQuestionAsked`, the `session.next*` streaming
events, etc.) now live only under `dist/v2/`.

**This is a typing change, not a protocol change.** The running `opencode
serve` binary (1.15.x) still emits those legacy events on the v1 `/event`
SSE stream and still serves `/question`, `/question/{id}/reply`,
`/permission/{id}/reply` — verify with `curl http://<server>/doc`. The
adapter casts events to `{ type: string; properties }` (untyped), so it
keeps receiving them and AskUserQuestion + reasoning streaming keep
working. **Do not conclude a feature is "removed" from the SDK npm types
alone — confirm against the binary's OpenAPI doc.**

Consequence: the `question.asked` / `message.part.delta` / `permission.asked`
handlers in `opencode/stream.ts` are correct at runtime but **not**
type-checked against the SDK (the cast hides them). The future-proofing
move — should the binary ever drop the legacy v1 stream in favour of
`session.next*` — is to migrate the adapter onto the typed `@opencode-ai/sdk/v2`
event protocol. Until then, v1 is intentional.

### 10.18 External (registry) MCP servers — proxied through the bridge

§10.12 covers the **internal** `clopen-mcp` bridge. **External** servers (the
ones users install from the registry, stored in `mcp_servers`) used to be
connected **directly** by each engine — a third-party URL or stdio command.
That is no longer true: **external servers are now proxied** through a
per-server endpoint `GET/POST/DELETE /mcp/ext/<slug>` on the same
Streamable-HTTP bridge (`backend/mcp/external/proxy.ts`, mounted in
`backend/index.ts`). Clopen connects to the upstream as an MCP **client** and
re-exposes its tools; the engine only ever talks to Clopen over loopback.

> **Why proxy instead of direct?** Engines connect with the MCP SDK's
> `Client.listTools()`, which eagerly compiles an Ajv validator for every
> tool's `outputSchema`. A single unresolvable `$ref` (Stitch ships
> `#/$defs/ScreenInstance`) makes it throw, the engine CLIs' `discoverTools`
> swallow the error, and the server advertises **zero** tools while still
> reporting "connected". That hid every remote server's tools on Qwen and every
> external server on Copilot. The proxy reads `tools/list` with a **raw**
> request (no Ajv), **drops `outputSchema`**, and repairs dangling `$ref`s in
> `inputSchema` — so one bad schema can't take down a whole server.

What this means for a new adapter:

1. **Your `getXxxExternalMcpConfig()` is a one-liner per server.** Emit a
   Streamable-HTTP remote pointing at `http://localhost:<port>/mcp/ext/<slug>`
   plus the **service-token** header (`getMcpServiceToken()`), in your SDK's
   shape. No stdio branch, no `oauth` flags, no third-party header forwarding —
   the proxy injects the upstream credential itself. Every existing builder is
   now identical bar the SDK field names
   (`getClaude/OpenCode/Codex/Copilot/QwenExternalMcpConfig`); mirror that.

2. **Use the engine's real URL/header field** — same per-SDK caveats as the
   internal bridge (§10.12), because the shape is identical:
   - OpenCode: `url` (`type:'remote'`); Claude/Copilot: `url` (`type:'http'`).
   - Qwen: `httpUrl`.
   - **Codex: `http_headers`** (a TOML table) — **not** `bearer_token`, which is
     rejected for `streamable_http` and aborts the run.
   - Copilot: set `tools: ['*']` so the CLI exposes the proxy's tools (its
     "undefined = all" default is not honoured for dynamically discovered
     servers).

> **Two token systems — don't conflate them.** The bridge (internal AND
> external endpoints) is authed by a process-scoped, in-memory **service token**
> sent only over loopback (`backend/mcp/internal/service-token.ts`). The
> **third-party credential** (OAuth token / API key, persisted in
> `mcp_servers.oauth` / `mcp_servers.headers`) is used by the **proxy**, on the
> upstream hop — never by the engine. `resolveServerRow()` injects
> `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for the proxy client; `stream-manager` calls
> `refreshExpiringExternalOAuth()` before the stream so that token is fresh.

Connection health is surfaced engine-agnostically by `mcp:status`
(`backend/mcp/external/probe.ts`) — `ok / needs_auth (OAuth) / needs_config
(missing API key) / unreachable / error`. A new adapter needs no work here.

What you must NOT do:
- ❌ Point an engine straight at a third-party MCP URL/command — route it
  through `/mcp/ext/<slug>` so schemas are sanitised and auth is centralized.
- ❌ Forward `mcp_servers.headers` (third-party creds) from a per-engine
  builder — that's the proxy's job; the builder only carries the service token.
- ❌ Use `bearer_token` for Codex remote MCP — use `http_headers`.
- ❌ Add a per-engine OAuth flow or token store — Clopen centralizes it.

### 10.19 Per-engine config-dir isolation (`{clopenDir}/engine/{engine}/user/`)

Every engine's CLI/SDK writes runtime state (credentials, session/rollout
files, logs, caches) to a home dir. Left at the default, that dir is the
user's **global** one — `~/.codex`, `~/.copilot`, `~/.config/opencode` +
`~/.local/share/opencode`, `~/.qwen` — so Clopen's activity gets mixed in
with the user's own standalone CLI usage. We isolate each engine to
`{clopenDir}/engine/{engine}/user/` (where `clopenDir` is `~/.clopen`, or
`~/.clopen-dev` in development) via that engine's home env var. The
`engine/` parent groups all AI-engine state in one place, separate from
Clopen's other data dirs (`{clopenDir}/snapshots/`, the DB, …). The helper
is `getEngineUserConfigDir(engine)` in `backend/utils/paths.ts` — one
source of truth; do not hand-join the path.

| Engine | Lever | Where set |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | `claude/environment.ts` (`getClaudeUserConfigDir()` → helper) |
| Codex | `CODEX_HOME` | `codex/credential.ts` (`CODEX_HOME` const) **+** the SDK's `env` in `codex/stream.ts` **+** the `codex login` PTY env in `ws/engine/codex/accounts.ts` |
| Copilot | `baseDirectory` (SDK sets `COPILOT_HOME`) | `copilot/stream.ts` `new CopilotClient({ baseDirectory })` |
| Qwen | `QWEN_RUNTIME_DIR` | `qwen/environment.ts` **+** `getQwenRuntimeDir()` in `qwen/session-fork.ts` |
| OpenCode | `XDG_DATA_HOME` / `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` / `XDG_STATE_HOME` / `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | `opencode/server.ts` spawn env |

Sharp edges, each of which silently defeats isolation if missed:

- **Codex SDK drops `process.env` when you pass `env`.** `@openai/codex-sdk`
  docs: *"When provided, the SDK will not inherit variables from
  `process.env`."* So you must pass the **full** `getCleanSpawnEnv()` and
  layer `CODEX_HOME` on top — passing `{ CODEX_HOME }` alone strips `PATH`,
  `HOME`, etc. and the subprocess fails to launch.
- **Set `CODEX_HOME` in every spawn site, not just the SDK.** `codex login`
  runs in a separate PTY (`ws/engine/codex/accounts.ts`); without
  `CODEX_HOME` there, the OAuth `auth.json` lands in `~/.codex` while the
  stream reads the isolated dir → "logged in but not authenticated".
- **Keep the fork helper's base in lockstep with the env var.** Codex's
  `session-fork.ts` reads `getCodexHomeDir()` and Qwen's reads
  `getQwenRuntimeDir()` — both resolve to the same isolated base the env
  var sets. If they drift, `sessionStateExists()` returns false and
  multi-branch checkpoints break (see §10.10).
- **Qwen isolation is partial — and that's accepted.** `QWEN_RUNTIME_DIR`
  relocates runtime output (chats/sessions, history, logs, tmp) but the
  CLI's global `settings.json` / OAuth creds still resolve to `~/.qwen`
  (`Storage.getGlobalQwenDir()`, no env override). Harmless here: Clopen
  uses paste-token auth, so those files are never written by our path.
- **OpenCode honors all four XDG bases and appends `/opencode` to each.**
  Setting `XDG_{DATA,CONFIG,STATE,CACHE}_HOME` to the isolated dir lands its
  state at `{clopenDir}/engine/opencode/user/opencode/…` (the extra
  `opencode/` segment is the XDG app-name namespace — unavoidable, and there
  is no single "data dir" env that skips it). Credentials + MCP config are
  injected via `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`, so the isolated data dir starts
  empty and needs no auth file carried over.
- **OpenCode reuses a persisted server — guard reuse on the data dir.**
  `opencode/server.ts` caches the live server's URL in the `settings` table
  (`opencode.server.url`) and reuses it across reconnects/restarts. A reused
  server keeps the env (and thus the data dir) it was **spawned** with, so a
  server left over from before isolation — or from a different isolation path
  — would silently keep writing to the old location even though the env is
  now correct. The fix: persist the spawned data dir as
  `opencode.server.datadir` and **refuse to reuse** when it ≠ the current
  `getEngineUserConfigDir('opencode')`; respawn instead. This was the actual
  bug behind "every engine isolated except OpenCode" — the binary respected
  XDG fine; a stale reused server was the culprit. Symptom to watch for: data
  still landing in `~/.local/share/opencode` after the env looks right.

**This is orthogonal to multi-account (§10.13).** All of an engine's Clopen
accounts share this **one** isolated dir; multiple accounts inside it are
still the auth-blob swap, **not** a dir per account.

**Two different "migration" questions — keep them apart:**

- **From the user's *global* dir (`~/.codex`, …) → no migration.** Forward-only
  by design: conversations created before isolation keep their session/rollout
  files in the global dir and lose engine-side resume continuity after the
  switch (the message history in Clopen's own DB is unaffected and still
  renders). Credentials are safe — they live in `engine_accounts.credential`
  and re-materialize into the isolated dir on next use. A clean-cut switch was
  chosen over copying because the shared-SQLite engines (Copilot's
  `session-store.db`, OpenCode's monolithic `opencode.db`) interleave Clopen
  and standalone sessions in one file, with no safe per-session extraction.
- **Between Clopen's *own* isolated layouts → yes, migrated.** An earlier build
  used `{clopenDir}/{engine}/user/` (no `engine/` parent). Migration
  `043_relocate_engine_config_dirs.ts` moves any such dir to the current
  `{clopenDir}/engine/{engine}/user/`. This is always safe — it only ever
  touches a path Clopen created, never the user's global home — and idempotent
  (skips when the new dir already exists; non-fatal on error). It also clears
  the persisted `opencode.server.{url,datadir}` so a server cached against the
  pre-move dir is re-spawned into the relocated one.

### 10.20 In-process SDK with a delta-stream, wrapped tools & no metadata (Cursor)

The `cursor` adapter (`@cursor/sdk`) surfaced a whole class of gotchas that recur
for any SDK whose stream is **delta-based**, whose tools are **wrapped/renamed**,
and whose model catalog is **metadata-poor**. Every point below cost a round-trip
of "user reports wrong UI → capture the real runtime shape → fix". **The meta-lesson:
never guess an SDK's runtime shapes from its `.d.ts`; capture them live** (write a
throwaway script that runs a real agent and `JSON.stringify`s each event/arg/result),
using the **same model** the user runs — different models stream differently.

**A. `run.stream()` yields per-chunk DELTAS, not snapshots.** Cursor emits a
separate `assistant`/`thinking` SDKMessage for *each* text chunk. Persisting each
as its own message produced 121 one-word rows for a "1+1=" reply and pushed the
user message off-screen. Fix: **accumulate** chunks into ONE `reasoning` + ONE
`assistant` message per block (buffers + flush at block-switch / tool-call /
turn-end), while emitting each chunk live as a transient `stream_event` delta.
Don't double-source: pick either `run.stream()` OR `onDelta`, not both, for the
same content. (§10.4 is the sibling "buffer for usage" lesson.)

**B. Tool arg field names are NOT what the `.d.ts` implies — and some payloads
live in the RESULT, not the args.** Cursor `edit` args carry only `{path}`; the
before/after is in the result's `value.diffString` (parse the unified diff into
`oldString`/`newString`). `glob`→`{globPattern}`, `write`→`{fileText}` (not
`content`). Getting these wrong = empty tool inputs in the UI. **Capture real args
at runtime.** When the payload arrives only at completion, DEFER that tool's
`tool_use` emission to the terminal event (like `edit`, `create_plan`).

**C. MCP servers AND in-process custom tools may be delivered through ONE wrapper
tool.** Cursor routes both through a tool literally named `mcp`, args
`{providerIdentifier, toolName, args}` (`clopen-mcp` for real MCP,
`custom-user-tools` for `local.customTools`). Unwrap it: `resolveOpenCodeToolName(toolName)`
→ `mcp__server__tool` (passthrough args) for real MCP, else `toCanonicalToolName(toolName)`
+ normalise for custom (e.g. AskUserQuestion). Without unwrap everything renders
as `Unknown:mcp`.

**D. Interactive tool (AskUserQuestion) args must come from the tool's `execute`,
not the stream.** The stream's `tool_call` args can arrive empty/partial for large
inputs (→ `questions:[]`). The custom-tool `execute` always receives complete
args, so emit the tool_use FROM `execute` (with the full questions) through a push
queue that merges with `run.stream()`, and have the converter SKIP the stream's
copy. `context.toolCallId` === the `tool_call` `call_id`, so `resolveUserAnswer`
still matches, and the `running` event fires while `execute` blocks (dialog shows
live, no deadlock). See §10.15 for the parent-routing half.

**E. Sub-agent activity may be nowhere in `run.stream()`.** Cursor runs the
`task` sub-agent internally: its steps ride `onDelta` `tool-call-delta` events
whose `taskUpdate` field is the sub-agent's inner InteractionUpdate; the outer
`callId` === the `task` `call_id` === the Agent tool_use id. Stream each
`taskUpdate.type==='tool-call-completed'` as a child tool_use+tool_result
(`parent.toolUseId`), and keep the full transcript in the `task` RESULT
(`value.conversationSteps[]`) as a FALLBACK. `subagentType` can be an OBJECT
(`{kind,name}`) — extract the string, or the UI shows "Using [object Object] agent".
Make the synthesised Agent tool's `description` param **required** (Pi/Cline) so
the model fills it; and in `AgentTool.svelte`, hide the description line when empty.

**F. Some capabilities emit NO tool event at all.** Cursor's web search / web
fetch run server-side — no `tool_call` in `run.stream()` or `onDelta`. They simply
cannot be rendered as tools. Enumerate the SDK's real tool-type set before
assuming a tool is "missing".

**G. Tool RESULT shapes vary and may hide huge binaries.** Cursor wraps results as
`{status, value:{content:[{text:{text}}]}}` (top-level) or `{success:{content}}`
(sub-agent); images arrive as raw `Buffer` bytes. `extractResultText` must unwrap
`value`/`success`, handle the nested `{text:{text}}` shape, and map images to a
`[image]` placeholder (else you serialise a 500 KB PNG buffer into the row).

**H. Mutable arg references corrupt persisted snapshots.** Cursor mutates some arg
objects in place across a tool's lifecycle (notably `update_todos` — statuses flip
to completed as work proceeds). Persisting a live reference makes a just-created
todo render as done. **`structuredClone` the args at emit time.** Also map the
SDK's status enum to the unified one (`inProgress`→`in_progress`, `cancelled`→
`completed`) — a value mismatch renders in-progress as pending.

**I. Usage that arrives once per turn needs backfill.** Cursor (like Codex) emits
`usage` once after all messages, so assistant rows persist `usage:null`. Add the
engine to `stream-manager.ts::backfillUsageForStream`'s gate so the turn's
aggregate is written to every assistant row (survives refresh).

**J. Don't fabricate a context window.** If `models.list()` reports no max context
(`limit.input:0`), do NOT hard-code one. `getContextUsage` returns `unknown:true`
and `ContextIndicator.svelte` shows "?" + an explanation instead of a bogus 100%.

**K. A "plan" tool is a user-facing checkpoint, not internal plumbing.** Cursor's
`create_plan` proposes a plan for the user to read, then ENDS the turn (approval
gate, like Claude's ExitPlanMode). Render its `plan` text as a normal assistant
markdown message, not a tool card; the user replies to continue.

**L. Runtime compatibility is a first-class risk (Bun).** `@cursor/sdk` uses
`@connectrpc/connect` over a Node transport that works under Bun with a valid
**paid** key. A free-tier/exhausted key returns `plan_required` (403) and
rate-limited keys surface as "socket connection closed / API key exchange
endpoint" NetworkErrors — do NOT misread these as a Bun incompatibility. The SDK's
fetch transport is gated behind a `globalThis.Deno` check; **faking that global is
UNSAFE** — 45+ files (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `openai`, `elysia`, `mongodb`,
`@google/genai`) platform-detect on `Deno` and would break. Map `plan_required`
and socket errors to clear user messages in `error-handler.ts`.

> **Global fixes that came out of this** (apply to ALL engines, not just Cursor):
> the List tool renders its directory listing with `CodeBlock` (monospace), not
> `TextMessage` (markdown); `AgentTool.svelte` hides an empty description line;
> `ContextIndicator.svelte` handles an unknown max context. When an engine's data
> exposes a UI bug, fix it in the shared component, not the adapter.

### 10.21 The SDK is not bundled — lazy-load it and never top-level-import it

Engine SDKs are **not** runtime dependencies. They live in `package.json`
`devDependencies` (pinned exact — the single source of truth) and are installed
**on demand** into the clopen-managed dir `~/.clopen/stack/engines`
(`getStackEnginesDir()`), never the user's global bun store or their project.
This is what fixed `bun add -g @myrialabs/clopen` aborting on Windows: bundling
the SDKs dragged 200–300 MB of native CLI binaries into the global install, and
one failed tarball extraction killed the whole thing.

Consequences for an adapter:

- **Reference SDK types only via `import type`.** A plain `import { Foo } from
  '<pkg>'` forces Bun to resolve the package at module-load time — which throws
  for every user who hasn't installed that engine yet. (It used to crash the
  whole backend at boot; since the registry loads adapters lazily it now fails
  only that engine — see §10.24.) `import type` is erased at runtime, so it's
  safe. Resolve the real module at point of use with
  `loadEngineSdk<typeof import('<pkg>')>('newengine', '<pkg>')` from
  `backend/engine/sdk-loader.ts` (which does `Bun.resolveSync(pkg, stackDir)` +
  dynamic import, cached).

- **Audit *every* file in the adapter, not just `stream.ts`.** This is the one
  rule that reliably survives the conversion and then gets violated again,
  because a leftover value import is **invisible in development**: the repo's
  own `node_modules` has the devDependency, so `import { query } from
  '@qwen-code/sdk'` resolves fine locally and only fails for end users, whose
  stack dir is the only copy. Three shipped adapters had exactly this — Qwen's
  `stream.ts` (`query`), OpenCode's `server.ts` (`createOpencodeClient`), and
  Pi's `models.ts` + `stream.ts` (`clampThinkingLevel`,
  `getSupportedThinkingLevels`) — all converted after the fact. A plain
  `await import('<pkg>')` is the same bug: it resolves from the process's own
  paths, not the stack dir. `loadEngineSdk` is the only correct seam.

- **It does not even fail consistently for end users — that is why it kept
  shipping.** A global install resolves a bare specifier by walking up to
  `~/.bun/install/global/node_modules`, which is **shared by every globally
  installed package**. So whether the missing SDK crashes depends on what else
  happens to live in that store: the Pi break was reported as "only on some
  devices, mostly fresh installs", and reinstalling bun "fixed" it because that
  rewrites the ambient store rather than the code. Treat "it works on my
  machine / it works after a reinstall" as *no evidence at all* here. Worse,
  when the package does happen to be there, the engine silently runs a version
  clopen never pinned or tested — the version guard only applies to the stack
  dir path.

- **The rule is now enforced, because writing it down three times did not
  work.** `bun run lint` rejects value imports of any `devDependency` from
  shipped runtime code (`bin/`, `backend/`, `shared/`, `scripts/start.ts`), with
  the restricted list derived from `package.json` so a newly added engine SDK is
  covered without touching the config. ESLint cannot see `await import(…)`,
  so `backend/shipped-runtime-imports.test.ts` walks the shipped module graph
  with `Bun.Transpiler.scanImports` — the same transpiler that runs the code, so
  type-only imports are erased exactly as at runtime — and fails on any
  specifier an end user could not resolve, including an undeclared package or
  one reaching into files `package.json` `files` does not ship. Both run in CI
  before `npm publish` (`needs: ci`).

- **Loading is version-guarded.** `loadEngineSdk` refuses an SDK whose installed
  version ≠ the pinned version, throwing `EngineNotReadyError`
  (`reason: 'not-installed' | 'needs-update'`). The stream-manager surfaces that
  message in the chat error surface, telling the user to install/update the
  engine in Settings → Stack. Don't catch-and-swallow it — the readable message
  is the UX.

- **Detection reads the stack dir, not PATH.** `readEngineSdkVersion(pkg)` (used
  by both `getToolStatus` in the Stack panel and every engine picker
  `status.ts`) checks the SDK's version inside `~/.clopen/stack/engines` — there
  is no CLI-on-PATH probe for engines anymore. `ToolStatus` also carries
  `requiredVersion` + `needsUpdate` so the UI can show "Update required".

The same lazy-load applies to the one non-adapter consumer of the Claude SDK:
`backend/mcp/index.ts::getEnabledMcpServers()` is `async` and lazy-loads
`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` only on the Claude path (see
`backend/mcp/README.md`).

### 10.22 Reasoning effort — keep it native, keep it capability-driven

Five of the eight engines expose a reasoning/thinking knob and **no two
call it the same thing**: Claude has `thinking` *and* `effort`, Codex has
`modelReasoningEffort`, Copilot has `SessionConfig.reasoningEffort`, Pi
has `thinkingLevel`, and Cursor has no dedicated field at all — it's one
entry in a generic `ModelSelection.params[]`. Their vocabularies don't
line up either (`minimal` exists only on Codex; `max`/`xhigh` only on
some Claude models; Pi's set is per-model).

The obvious design — normalize everything to `low | medium | high` —
loses information in both directions: it can't express `off`, and it
either hides levels a model does support or offers levels it doesn't.
So the token stays **native and opaque** end to end. `EngineQueryOptions.
reasoningEffort` is a `string` that only the adapter which produced it
(in its `models.ts`) knows how to read (in its `stream.ts`); the
stream-manager, the WS layer, the session row, and the frontend all just
carry it.

Three consequences worth internalizing:

**The model advertises, the UI obeys.** `EngineModel.capabilities.
reasoningControl` (`{ levels, default }`) is the entire contract. The
picker renders a pill when it's present and nothing when it's absent —
which is how Qwen, OpenCode, and Cline stay knob-less without a single
engine name appearing in the frontend. Prefer deriving the level list
from the SDK's own payload (Copilot's `supportedReasoningEfforts`, Pi's
`getSupportedThinkingLevels`, Cursor's `ModelParameterDefinition`) over
hardcoding; only static catalogs (Claude, Codex) spell it out.

**Clamp on the way in.** The token reaching `streamQuery` may be stale —
persisted on a session whose model has since changed, or restored from a
`reasoningDefaults` entry written by an older catalog. Every adapter
validates against its own set and falls back to the engine default
instead of forwarding garbage to the SDK (`clampThinkingLevel` for Pi, a
literal `Set` for Claude/Codex/Copilot, a `::`-shape check for Cursor).

**Encode structure in the value, not in new fields.** Cursor needs a
parameter *id* alongside the level, so its tokens are
`"<paramId>::<value>"` and `buildCursorModelSelection` splits them back
apart. That keeps `EngineQueryOptions` at one string no matter how
baroque the next SDK's knob turns out to be. Resist adding a second
field for the sixth engine.

The frontend keeps `chatModelState.reasoningEffort` at the **effective**
level rather than "only what the user explicitly picked" — an `$effect`
re-seeds it on every model change from `settings.reasoningDefaults[modelId]`
→ `reasoningControl.default`, and nulls it for knob-less models. That
costs one effect and buys two things: the value sent with the turn always
matches what actually ran (so `MessageEngine.reasoningEffort` in the Raw
view is truthful), and a level valid for the previous model can never
leak into a request for the next one.

---

### 10.23 Switching engine mid-session — replay the branch, and distrust "obvious" boundaries

Continuity is delegated to each engine's native session store, and those
ids are not portable: a Claude session id, a Codex rollout file, an
OpenCode server session, Cline's in-memory transcript. So a chat that
changes engine has nothing for the new engine to resume. Clopen's DB is
the only engine-agnostic record of the conversation, which makes
**replaying the branch as prompt content** the only mechanism that works
for all eight adapters. It lives in `backend/chat/engine-handoff.ts` and
needs no adapter, `AIEngine` or migration change.

**Gate `resume` on the engine that produced the branch, not on the
session.** `chat_sessions.engine` names the *currently selected* engine
(`chat:model-sync` persists it the moment anyone picks one), which in a
switched session is precisely the wrong answer. Walk back to the most
recent **non-user** message and read its `engine.type`; user messages
carry the sender's choice, not the producer's. Feeding a foreign id to an
adapter degrades inconsistently — Codex, Copilot, Pi and Cline catch it
and start fresh (silent amnesia), while OpenCode falls back to the raw id
against a server that never had it, and Claude passes it straight to the
SDK with no existence check.

**Two boundary assumptions failed here; both looked obvious.**

1. *"Replay from the last `compact_boundary` — that's what the engine
   itself was holding."* Only the **Claude** adapter ever emits one.
   OpenCode explicitly drops compaction events (`message-converter.ts`,
   "Skip: … compaction") and Pi disables compaction outright
   (`compaction: { enabled: false }`). On 7 of 8 engines the rule
   silently becomes "replay everything from message one" — the unbounded
   case it was supposed to prevent.
2. *"No boundary means it all fit in the source engine's window."* Not
   so. Context editing is explicitly designed around the client keeping
   full history while the server edits it, so a client-side transcript
   that is much larger than the engine's live context is the normal
   case, not an exotic one.

The window is therefore an **estimated token budget**, which every engine
has, rather than a marker only one engine emits.

**Copy a measured default instead of inventing a heuristic.** The rule is
one sentence — replay verbatim; past the trigger, tool results older than
the last N tool uses become a placeholder and tool *inputs* are always
kept — and both numbers are the shipped defaults of Anthropic's
[`clear_tool_uses_20250919`](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing)
(trigger 100k input tokens, keep 3 tool uses, `clear_tool_inputs: false`).
Tool results are the right thing to drop first because they are
re-derivable — the new engine is in the same project directory and can
read the file again — and because clearing them is *measured* to help:
+29% on agentic benchmarks, 84% token reduction on long tool-heavy runs.
Resist adding a fallback ladder on top; a ladder is how a rule becomes
unpredictable.

**Two invariants that are easy to miss:**

- The turn's own user message is already saved and *is* the branch head
  when the handoff runs. Without `excludeMessageId` the transcript ends
  with a verbatim copy of the message the engine is about to answer.
- Attachments need **two** gates: `EngineModel.modalities.input` (what
  the model accepts) and an adapter table (what the adapter forwards).
  They disagree — Codex, Cursor, Pi and Cline have no document path at
  all. Copilot forwarded text only until its `blob` attachment support
  was wired up, silently dropping every image despite `models.ts`
  advertising `image: !!supports?.vision`.

Finally: the handoff is prepended to the **engine prompt only**. The
persisted `UserMessage` stays clean, so the transcript never reaches the
DB or the timeline, and the user sees nothing but a changed engine.

### 10.24 One adapter must not be able to break every engine

The registry used to import all eight adapters statically. That made every
user's startup depend on every adapter loading cleanly — so when Pi's
`stream.ts` carried a value import of `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (§10.21), the
symptom was not "Pi is unavailable". It was:

```
Clopen v0.4.26
error: Cannot find module '@earendil-works/pi-ai' from
  '/home/rust/.bun/install/global/node_modules/@myrialabs/clopen/backend/engine/adapters/pi/stream.ts'
```

The process died at boot. Someone who only ever used Claude lost the entire
app to an engine they had never selected, with no UI to tell them why.

`ENGINE_LOADERS` in `backend/engine/index.ts` is now the only reference to an
adapter module, and every entry is a dynamic `import()`. Being a total
`Record<EngineType, …>`, a new engine will not type-check until its loader is
registered — the exhaustiveness the old `switch` needed a runtime `default`
branch to approximate.

Four things that were deliberate, and would each be easy to "improve" back
into a bug:

- **The failed load is not caught.** There is exactly one place that decides
  what an unusable engine means to the user — `checkEngineSetup`, whose message
  embeds "Settings → Stack" and renders as a one-click **Open Stack** button
  (`frontend/components/chat/formatters/ErrorMessage.svelte`). A second
  handler here would let a broken engine masquerade as a working one. And
  translating a module-load failure into an install prompt is worse than
  showing the raw error: it sends people reinstalling for a bug no reinstall
  can fix, which is exactly how §10.21 stayed alive for three releases.

- **The cache holds a promise, not an instance.** Creation is async now, so
  two concurrent callers racing to build two engines for one project would
  split the abort controller — a cancel that cancels nothing. A failed load is
  evicted rather than cached, so a user can install the engine in Settings →
  Stack and retry without restarting the server.

- **`findProjectEngine` exists so lookups cannot create.** Cancelling a stream
  and routing an `AskUserQuestion` answer both act on a stream that is already
  running, so the engine must already exist. The old code called
  `getProjectEngine` and silently built a fresh instance when it did not —
  an engine with nothing to cancel and no pending question. Reach for
  `findProjectEngine` whenever "not there" is a real answer.

- **`disposeOpenCodeClient` is imported from `adapters/opencode/server`, not
  the barrel.** Shutdown must release that module's process-wide client
  singleton, but importing it through `adapters/opencode` would drag
  `OpenCodeEngine` into the boot graph and undo the whole change. Both paths
  resolve to the same module instance (ESM caches by resolved path), so the
  singleton is not duplicated.

`backend/engine/index.test.ts` is what keeps this true. It walks the eager
import closure of `backend/index.ts` — following static imports only, the way
the runtime evaluates them — and fails if any adapter's engine class is
reachable, so smuggling the import into some other boot-path file is caught
too. It also asserts each key loads *its own* adapter: mapping `cursor` to
`ClineEngine` type-checks with zero errors and would route a user's chat
through the wrong SDK, and nothing but that check catches it.

---

### 10.25 Upgrading engine SDKs — the type-checker only sees half of it

The August 2026 pass moved all eleven engine packages to current (Claude
0.3.158 → 0.3.229, Copilot beta.9 → 1.0.9 + CLI 1.0.55 → 1.0.79, Codex 0.135 →
0.147, OpenCode 1.15.12 → 1.18.18, Pi 0.80.10 → 0.84.1, Cline 0.0.65 → 0.0.74,
Cursor 1.0.24 → 1.0.27, Qwen 0.1.7 → 0.1.8). `bun run check` reported exactly
two errors — and neither of them was one of the three real problems. What the
type-checker cannot see is where the work is:

- **A new *blocking* event is a hang, not a type error.** Copilot 1.0.9 added
  `session_limits_exhausted.requested`: the model request stops until a client
  answers it over `session.rpc.ui.handlePendingSessionLimitsExhausted`. An
  unhandled `case` compiles perfectly and the turn simply never produces
  output. Before shipping an upgrade, diff the event union for anything named
  `*.requested` / `*.asked` / `*_request` and check whether it has a paired
  `.completed` — that pairing is the tell for "someone must answer this".
  Clopen answers `cancel` and surfaces a notification: three of the four
  actions raise the user's AI-credit ceiling, and no auto-approval policy
  covers spending someone's money.

- **A new *informational* message type is silent data loss.** Claude's
  `SDKMessage` grew eight members; two of them (`model_refusal_fallback`,
  `model_refusal_no_fallback`) are precisely the cases a user notices — the
  answer came from a model they did not pick, or no answer came at all — and
  the converter's `default` arm swallowed both. Adapters end their dispatch
  with a catch-all by design, so every SDK bump must diff the union rather than
  trust a clean compile.

- **A static model catalog goes stale on the same clock, and the CLI knows the
  answer.** The Codex bump moved the whole lineup: `gpt-5.6-sol/terra/luna`
  appeared, `gpt-5.3-codex` and the `gpt-5.4` pair left, `gpt-5.5` stopped being
  ChatGPT-only, the context window went 200k → 272k, `minimal` stopped being a
  valid effort and `max`/`ultra` became one. None of that surfaces as a type
  error — a wrong slug fails at runtime, inside the CLI, as somebody's chat.
  Do not transcribe the docs: the shipped binary embeds its own preset table
  (`strings <codex-binary>`, search `"models": [`) with slug, `display_name`,
  `context_window`, `default_reasoning_level`, `supported_reasoning_levels`,
  `visibility` and `priority`. That is what the client actually accepts, and
  `backend/engine/adapters/codex/models.ts` mirrors it field for field. Treat
  the public docs as the second source, not the first — and remember the CLI
  also fetches account-entitled models from the server, so absence from the
  embedded table is not proof of removal (that is why `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`
  stayed).

- **Peer dependencies float even when the SDK is pinned.**
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` ships no dependencies: `@anthropic-ai/sdk`,
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `zod` are peers. `ENGINE_PACKAGES` listed
  only the SDK, so `bun add` resolved all three at `@latest` inside
  `~/.clopen/stack/engines` — a real install carried `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
  0.115.0 while clopen type-checked against its pinned 0.100.1. Same class as
  the typebox float (#362). The peers are pinned explicitly now. When adding an
  engine, read its `peerDependencies`, not just its `dependencies`.

**Known gap, deliberately not closed:** `SDKModelRefusalFallbackMessage`
carries `retracted_message_uuids` — messages the CLI has *withdrawn* after
delivering them. Clopen's `messageId` for Claude is the SDK uuid, so honouring
it is feasible, but it needs a retraction event threaded through
adapter → stream-manager → WS → frontend removal. Until then the refused
partial stays in the transcript above the fallback answer, and the toast is
what explains it.

A second gap worth naming: the SDK's own types can lag the CLI it drives.
`ModelReasoningEffort` still stops at `xhigh` in codex-sdk 0.147 while the CLI
enum runs to `max` and `ultra`, and the SDK never validates — it interpolates
the string into `--config model_reasoning_effort="…"`. Reading the transport,
not just the type, is what made GPT-5.6's top levels reachable. Cast at the SDK
boundary and gate the value in one place (`resolveCodexEffort`), never by a
second copy of the allow-list next to the call site — that copy is exactly what
had gone stale.

The mechanical part of an upgrade is cheap; budget the time for the union
diffs. `/tmp`-installing the old and new versions side by side and diffing the
`type: "…"` literals in each SDK's event declarations found every item above in
minutes.

**The September 2026 Claude pass (0.3.229 → 0.3.284) added one more trap, and
it is the reverse of the stale-catalog item above.** Here the catalog was
*right* and the binary was behind. `models.ts` listed `claude-opus-5-5`,
`claude-sonnet-5-5` and `claude-fable-5-1`, but the CLI bundled with 0.3.229 is
2.1.229, whose embedded model table predates all three — so picking any of them
failed inside the CLI with `Claude Code 2.1.229 does not support this model;
version 2.1.280 or newer is required`. Nothing in Clopen could have caught it:
the slugs are correct, the types compile, and the engine is installed and
healthy. The rule that follows is bidirectional, because the SDK pin and the
model catalog are one decision wearing two hats:

- Adding a model to `models.ts` is not done until the **pinned** SDK's bundled
  CLI knows the slug. `strings -a node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-<platform>-<arch>/claude | grep -oE 'claude-(opus|sonnet|haiku|fable)-[0-9-]+' | sort -u`
  answers it in seconds, the same read `codex/models.ts` does for Codex.
- Bumping the SDK is therefore a **model-availability change**, not only a type
  change, and belongs in the PR description as one. The Claude CLI ships as a
  platform package of the SDK (`engine-cli.ts` → `claudeCandidates`), so the two
  versions move together and cannot be bumped apart.

Two smaller findings from the same pass, both worth reusing:

- **An unchanged union is itself a result, but only if you diff for it.**
  `SDKMessage` was byte-identical across the 55 versions, which is what made the
  upgrade safe — not the clean compile. Diffing every type's *fields* (not just
  the member names) is what proved it: `Options` gained five optional entries,
  `Query` three methods, and the only removals anywhere were
  `Settings.policyHelpers` and two control requests, none referenced by Clopen.
- **A cast at the SDK boundary erased the two states that decide a toast.** The
  `system:init` payload types `mcp_servers[].status` as a bare `string`, while
  the SDK *separately* exports a richer `McpServerStatus` for a different API
  surface — so the obvious `as 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'error'` looked
  authoritative and was fiction. `pending` and `needs-auth` are not failures,
  and 0.3.282 made `pending` routine by connecting MCP servers in the
  background. Both the Claude and Qwen converters carried the same invented
  union; the vocabulary now lives once in `toMcpServerStatus`
  (`shared/types/unified/stream.ts`), for the same reason `resolveCodexEffort`
  does.

**`prewarm()` (0.3.284, `@alpha`) was evaluated and declined.** It parks a spare
Claude Code process so process start, auth, tools, plugins and MCP handshakes
come off the first message — but `claim()` can only set `cwd`,
`additionalDirectories`, `model`, `permissionMode`, `maxThinkingTokens`, a
settings overlay, `appendSystemPrompt`, `title`, `agents` and three named
environment variables. Everything else is frozen at `prewarm()`, including the
four things Clopen varies per stream: `mcpServers` (whose tool handlers are
bound to a project via `mcpContext`), `hooks` (the PreToolUse permission hook is
per project + profile), `canUseTool` (its closure captures the per-stream run),
and `env` (git identity is not one of the three claimable variables). A spare is
therefore only reusable inside one `(project × profile × account × identity)`
and holds 230–260 MB while parked, which does not fit the low-spec/VPS target.
If it is revisited: it needs a spare registry keyed on that tuple, a
default-off setting, and a fallback that special-cases `option_not_applied` —
that rejection means the session is **already running**, so the naive
"fall back to `query()`" double-sends the prompt.

### 10.26 One engine instance, many chats — per-stream state cannot live on it

A user with two chats streaming in one project pressed **Stop** in one of them.
Both stopped.

`getProjectEngine(projectId, type)` returns one instance per project, and the
adapters read that as "one stream at a time". Every one of the eight kept the
running stream's handles in instance fields:

```ts
private activeController: AbortController | null = null;
private activeQuery: Query | null = null;          // opencode: activeSessionId,
                                                   // activeServer, activeHolder
```

Clopen's stream-manager has always allowed concurrent streams — one per
`(project, chat session)`, not one per project. So the second chat to start
overwrote the first chat's handles, and `cancel()` operated on whatever was in
the fields:

- **Stop hit the wrong chat.** With chats A and B streaming, cancelling A ran
  `client.session.abort(activeSessionId)` — B's id. Both died. Before a
  frontend fix that made Stop target the *viewed* session, the mis-target on
  each side cancelled out and the bug read as "Stop needs two presses".
- **`isActive` lied.** The first stream's `finally` nulled the shared fields,
  so the instance reported idle while the second was still running. Engine
  retirement (§10.14's successor: evict now, dispose once idle) took that at
  face value and disposed the engine mid-answer — the exact bug retirement was
  built to prevent.
- **Resources leaked.** OpenCode's `activeHolder` is the pool hold that keeps a
  per-Profile server from being reaped. The second stream overwrote it, so the
  first stream's hold was never released and that server was pinned forever.
- **Replies went to the wrong server.** Two chats on different Profiles sit on
  different pooled servers; permission and question replies read
  `this.activeServer`, so one chat's approval was POSTed into the other's
  server and its own tool call sat waiting.

The fix is structural, not a guard: per-stream state moved into an
`EngineRuns<XxxRun>` registry ([`adapters/run-registry.ts`](../adapters/run-registry.ts))
keyed by the AbortController the caller passed to `streamQuery` — the same
object `StreamState.abortController` holds, so the stream-manager and the
adapter already agree on it without minting an id. `isActive` counts runs, the
stream's `finally` retires only its own, and each adapter implements teardown
once in `stopRuns(targets)`.

Three details worth keeping:

- **`cancel(owner)` takes a required parameter.** An optional one invites
  `cancel()` at a call site that has a specific stream in mind, which is the
  original bug with a nicer signature. Stopping every run is `dispose()`'s job.
- **An owner that has already finished cancels nothing.** The tempting fallback
  — "not found, so stop what's left" — reproduces the bug exactly: the runs that
  are left belong to other chats. This is the case `run-registry.test.ts` pins.
- **Release shared resources after the RPC, not before.** OpenCode's hold is
  handed back only once `session.abort()` has returned; releasing first can let
  the server be reaped out from under that very call.

One boundary this does **not** cover: `isActive` counts streaming runs, so a
`generateStructured` call in flight still reads as idle. Those run on the global
singleton tier (`initializeEngine`), not the per-project one, so they are a
separate problem — but if a future engine routes one-shot generation through a
project engine, it has to register a run like everything else.

What made this survive so long is that the contract doc *taught* it: invariant 2
used to read "Streaming state lives on the instance … automatically isolated
per-project". It was true about projects and silently wrong about chat sessions.
When an invariant is scoped, write down what it does **not** cover.

### 10.27 A tool id is scoped to the SDK session that minted it

The Task Progress panel showed a plan that could never finish. Turn 1 created
three tasks and completed them; turn 2 created two more and, as the user put it,
"updated 1-2 instead of continuing from 4". The count settled at half done and
stayed there.

`TodoWrite` sent a full snapshot per call, so reading it was "take the last
one". The Task tools that replaced it (`TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate`, SDK
0.3.142+) are deltas — one task per create, patched by `taskId` — so the panel
replays them. The replay keyed tasks on a **single counter over the whole
conversation**, on the assumption that the engine numbers tasks the same way.
It does not. Clopen sends every turn with `forkSession: true`, so each turn runs
under a fresh SDK session whose task store starts empty and **whose ids restart
at 1**.

Reading it out of the database made the damage exact. In one real session turn 6
created ten tasks (ids 1-10), turn 7 created seven more that the engine also
numbered 1-7, and turn 9 three more numbered 1-3. The replay handed turn 7's
creates the synthetic ids 11-17 while turn 7's updates still said 1-7 — so every
later turn's status landed on **turn 6's rows**, and its own tasks never left
`pending`. The panel read 10/20 = 50% forever, and the header named a turn-6
task while the agent worked on a turn-9 one. Replaying that same session through
the fix yields 3/3.

The engine had been saying so all along: across the whole database, every
`TaskList` call answers `No tasks found`, each one issued in a turn *after*
tasks were created. An empty store per fork is not an edge case, it is the
normal shape.

So the id namespace is the SDK session, and the rules that follow are worth
keeping for any future delta-keyed tool:

- **Key per session, not per conversation.** A create arriving under a new
  `message.sessionId` starts that session's list from scratch. The same
  reasoning as §10.23: an SDK session id is only meaningful to the engine that
  minted it, and so is anything numbered inside it.
- **Only creates open a namespace; updates never do.** A turn that patches
  without creating is a continuation, and clearing on it would discard the list
  those patches refer to — the case if the engine ever persists its store
  across a fork.
- **Prefer the id the engine reports over one you derive.** `TaskCreate`'s
  result reads `Task #4 created successfully: …`; parse it, and fall back to
  counting *within the namespace* only while the result is still in flight.
  The old counter was not wrong because counting is wrong, it was wrong because
  it counted across a boundary the ids do not cross.
- **Do not invent a row for an id you never saw created.** The old `upsert`
  defaulted a missing subject to the id, so a stray patch entered the list as a
  task literally labelled `7` — reachable whenever the loaded message window
  opens partway through a turn. Skip it unless the patch names the task.

Two pieces of dead code hid the bug's surface. The replay read
`item.result?.content` for `TaskList` snapshots, but that widget consumes the
**raw** message list while `ToolUseBlock.result` is populated by the grouper
that feeds the rendered list — across 2140 stored Task blocks, not one carries a
`result`. And what it tried to parse (`{ tasks: [...] }`) is not a shape
`TaskList` returns; its result is prose. A branch that cannot fire will not tell
you its premise is wrong, so the replay lives in
`frontend/utils/chat/task-progress.ts` now, behind unit tests that state each
scenario, rather than inside a `$derived` where no test could reach it.
