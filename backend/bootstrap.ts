/**
 * Post-database-init bootstrap
 *
 * Re-establishes code-defined built-ins that live OUTSIDE the migration/seeder
 * pipeline — internal MCP servers (e.g. Browser Automation) synced from code,
 * and the default engine install. These are normally set up once at server
 * startup, right after `initializeDatabase()`.
 *
 * "Clear All Data" wipes the whole ~/.clopen directory and re-runs only
 * migrations + seeders on the SAME live process, so anything established here
 * would silently vanish until the next restart. Sharing this function between
 * startup and the clear-data handler keeps built-ins alive across a data reset
 * without a restart — and means any future startup-synced built-in is covered
 * automatically.
