/**
 * Artifact framework — shared capability matrix for engine "extension" artifacts.
 *
 * Clopen manages several kinds of engine artifact (Agent Skills — which cover
 * both model-invoked skills and user-invoked `/slash` prompts — Subagents, and
 * project Instructions). They differ in file shape but share one mechanic: a canonical source (DB metadata + on-disk store, or a repo file)
 * is MATERIALIZED into the shape each engine consumes at stream start.
 *
 * Rather than hardcode that mechanic per feature (as the original Skills sync
 * did), every `artifactType × engine × scope` combination is described by a
 * single {@link ArtifactResolution}. Generic writers/scanners (see `sync.ts` and
 * `detect.ts`) act on that description, so a new feature is a configuration in
 * `matrix.ts` — not a new copy of the sync/detect logic.
 *
 * Two materialization strategies recur, mirroring the two engine families:
 *   - NATIVE (Claude, Qwen, Copilot): the engine reads a real artifact directory.
 *     Clopen mirrors each managed folder/file there (`folder-md` / `single-md`),
 *     touching only the slugs it owns.
 *   - SYNTHETIC (Codex, OpenCode): no native concept, so Clopen injects a
 *     marker-delimited block (`preamble-region`) into the engine's global
 *     instructions file.
 *
 * `'mcp'` is intentionally reserved in {@link ArtifactType} but has NO adapter
 * here: MCP servers are not file artifacts — they are config objects composed
 * per engine and proxied through the `/mcp/ext/<slug>` bridge (see
 * `backend/mcp/`). Forcing MCP through a file writer/detector would be a
 * mis-fit, so it keeps its existing config-object path. The slot exists only so
 * the type is extensible if a file-shaped MCP concern ever appears.
 */

/**
 * Engine keys used across the framework. These are the *config-dir* slugs (e.g.
 * `'claude'`, not the `EngineType` `'claude-code'`) so they line up with
 * {@link getEngineUserConfigDir} and the original Skills sync.

 * is a runtime hook (see `backend/permissions/`), and the matrix entry only
 * describes the optional on-disk "honesty" file (Claude `settings.json`, Codex
 * `config.toml`) for engines that read one.
 *
 * `'command'` is LEGACY. Commands merged into Skills in migration 079: a command
 * is a Skill whose `triggers` include `slash`, and Clopen expands `/<slug>` into
 * the prompt itself rather than materializing a file each engine may or may not
 * read. The type survives only so the sync path can clean up the directories and
 * `CLOPEN:COMMANDS` blocks earlier versions wrote.
