# Third-Party Integrations — Implementation Specs

Every entry below is numbered, and one task is one implementation session. Each
task carries its own checklist and notes line: on finishing one, tick the box and
replace the `—` with a nested bullet list recording what was actually built,
which decisions were taken, and where the implementation deviated from this spec
— the next session reads those notes, not the diff. ONE BULLET PER TOPIC, opened
by a bolded label, grouped by subject rather than by the order things happened:
later passes and reversals belong inside the topic bullet they corrected, so a
reader looking for how auth works finds one place and not a chronology.

**Goal.** Two outcomes at once: a *product story* (a visible catalogue of
integrations that attracts new users) and *workflow depth* (a handful of
integrations that genuinely change how a session is worked).

**Order.** Strictly ascending, and the grouping is the reason why. `Foundation`
holds the credential layer everything else registers with. `Surfaces` each build
one provider-agnostic capability plus the first provider that proves its shape.
`Providers` and `Catalogue` only plug into what already exists — an entry in
those sections that finds itself building a new panel has hit a gap in the
surface it targets, and the fix belongs in that surface, not in a second panel.

---

## Architecture

Read this before any entry. It is the part that is easy to get subtly wrong, and
getting it wrong produces two places to connect the same service.

**A connected account is not a feature. It is a credential with capabilities.**
`Task 1` stores one row per connected third-party account, and that row is the
only place its credential lives. Everything that talks to that service reads
through the account instead of keeping its own copy.

**Settings → Integrations is where you connect. It is not where you work.** The
hub owns connect, disconnect, credentials, capability toggles and health. What an
integration actually *does* lives in the surface that owns that kind of work:

| Capability | Surface that owns it | Registered by |
|---|---|---|
| Agent tools | the engines, via an `mcp_servers` row | Task 1 |
| Issues, PRs, CI | Issues panel | Task 2 |
| Deployments, build logs | Deployments panel | Task 3 |
| Database connection | DB Client | Task 4 |
| Worktree lifecycle | worktree manager | Task 5 |
| Notifications and approvals | notification channels | Task 6 |
| Inbound events | webhook gateway | Task 1 |

**Surface rows are projections.** An account with the agent-tools capability
writes an `mcp_servers` row; one with a database capability writes a
`db_client_connections` row. Those rows are *derived* — regenerated from the
account whenever its credential or capabilities change, marked as
integration-managed, and read-only wherever they surface. Nothing reads a token
out of a projection to decide anything, and no subsystem downstream of a
projection needs to know accounts exist. That constraint is what keeps this layer
off the path every engine's MCP config already flows through.

**Connecting can start anywhere; the account still lives in one place.** DB
Client's "add connection" offers the database providers, the worktree manager
offers the branching ones, and both open the same connect dialog the hub does. A
user already in DB Client must never be told to go to Settings first.

**An integration is not automatically an MCP server.** Roughly half the entries
below expose no tools at all — Neon is a worktree hook, Turso is a driver, the
chat channels are adapters. Agent tools is one capability among several, and the
catalogue is the only section where it is the *only* one.

---

## Existing rails — reuse, do not reinvent

- `backend/mcp/external/` already installs any server from the official MCP
  registry, proxies it at `/mcp/ext/<slug>`, and centralises OAuth (RFC 8414
  discovery, RFC 7591 dynamic registration, PKCE). Note the audience: that token
  authorises the *MCP server*, not the vendor's REST API, so a provider needing
  both declares two credentials rather than reusing one.
- `backend/db-client/drivers/` already speaks postgres, mysql, mssql, mongodb,
  redis and sqlite with `sslMode`, and the DB Client panel already has a schema
  tree, structure manager, ER diagram and query console.
- `backend/mcp/internal/servers/` (`defineServer()`) is how a first-class
  capability is exposed to every engine at once, and is the pattern the provider
  registry mirrors.
- Existing primitives worth composing with: worktrees, preview + browser
  automation, ports, tunnel, terminal, git, memory graph, remote access,
  notifications.
- `@myrialabs/chatkit` is the single path for every chat platform (Telegram,
  WhatsApp, Discord, Slack). Never write a per-platform bot client by hand. It
  is a co-developed sibling repo consumed locally, so a gap in ChatKit is fixed
  in ChatKit — generically, never with a Clopen-shaped patch.
- Brand marks follow `shared/constants/tool-icons.ts`: inline SVG with a light
  and a dark variant, keyed by id, rendered with `{@html}`. Not an icon font —
  a monochrome glyph tinted with the theme foreground stops being a logo.

## House rules

Bun + Elysia, WebSocket-first (register every event in the `.emit` schema block),
Svelte 5 runes, `debug` logger, one numbered migration per schema change,
cross-platform (Linux/macOS/Windows), and credentials only ever through the
`Task 1` account layer — never a per-integration settings blob, and never a
second copy in the subsystem that consumes them.

---

# Foundation

**Task 1 — Account layer, encrypted credentials, inbound events, hub.** Build the
substrate every later entry registers with, as one piece of work.

*Provider registry.* A single source-of-truth registry in code, mirroring the
internal-MCP `defineServer()` pattern, where each provider declares id, display
name, category, auth method (api-key / oauth-device / oauth-code / mcp-oauth /
connection-string / none), credential field shapes, the capabilities it can
offer, and an optional MCP preset that maps the stored credential onto the env
vars or headers the upstream server expects. Providers carry no icon field — the
brand mark is keyed by provider id in the shared brand-mark constant, so a
provider without artwork falls back to a generic glyph rather than blocking.

*Accounts.* One table owning every third-party credential, keyed
`(provider, account_label)` with a nullable project binding so two projects can
point at different orgs. Connecting projects the account onto the surfaces its
capabilities name; changing a credential or toggling a capability re-projects;
disconnecting cleans up. A projection must ADOPT an unowned row already sitting
on the preset's slug rather than creating a sibling — a user who installed that
MCP server by hand before the provider existed must end up with one entry, not
two — and releasing it on disconnect must leave their own row intact.

*Encryption at rest.* Clopen stores secrets as plaintext today, which becomes
materially riskier once it holds GitHub, Vercel and Supabase tokens. Seal them
with AES-256-GCM in a prefixed envelope carrying a key fingerprint, applied at
the DATABASE QUERY LAYER so every existing caller keeps working in plaintext. The
prefix is what makes the rollout safe: an unprefixed value is pre-migration
plaintext and passes through untouched, and re-sealing an already-sealed value is
a no-op, so a half-migrated table reads correctly and a re-run migration cannot
double-encrypt. Decryption must NEVER throw — a value the active key cannot open
returns null and increments a counter the hub surfaces as a banner, because
throwing would take down every read path that touches a stored connection the
moment a key went missing. Key resolution is a generated file in the data
directory plus a `CLOPEN_MASTER_KEY` environment override, deliberately NOT bound
to a machine id: binding would make a restored backup undecryptable on a new
host, and self-hosters migrate hosts. State the real threat model in the module
and the UI — this protects a database that leaves the machine, not local root.

*Migration.* One migration creating the tables, and a second re-encrypting every
existing secret: MCP env, headers and OAuth state, db-client and SSH passwords,
SSH private keys and passphrases, and engine account credentials. It must use RAW
SQL rather than the query modules, which now seal on write and open on read —
routing it through them would encrypt an already-encrypted value on the way in
and hand back plaintext on the way out, appearing to do nothing while corrupting
every row. `down()` must decrypt back to plaintext, or a rollback is data loss.

*OAuth ownership.* For providers whose MCP server drives its own OAuth, the
account is the durable owner and `mcp_servers.oauth` stays a projection that is
still the READ path — so `resolveServerRow()` and every per-engine config builder
keep reading exactly what they read before, and nothing on that path changes.

*Inbound events.* One signed endpoint, `/api/integrations/hooks/<provider>`, with
per-provider signature verification over the RAW request bytes (a JSON round-trip
reorders keys and invalidates a valid signature), replay rejection backed by a
unique constraint on `(provider, delivery_id)` rather than a read-then-write
check, a per-provider rate limit, and a body size cap applied before parsing.
Treat it as a new attack surface: deny by default, answer 404 for an unknown
provider AND for a disabled one so an unauthenticated caller cannot enumerate
what is connected, and log every rejection. It ships with no subscriber and no UI
of its own; `Task 7` is the first consumer.

*Hub.* Settings gains an Integrations section that ABSORBS the existing
Connectors section rather than sitting beside it — two places to connect a
service means two tokens in two tables. One list holds everything Clopen can use,
with filter pills for All / Built-in / Integrations / Custom MCP, and a catalogue
of curated providers not yet connected. Browsing the official MCP registry and
installing anything from it stays exactly as possible as it is today, it just
stops being the front door. One unified detail view serves every row, with
sections appearing according to what the row is: account and capabilities for a
connected provider, editable configuration for a hand-installed server, and
per-tool + per-engine exposure, the tool inspector, health detail and the raw
config an engine receives for anything backed by MCP. Do not add a standalone
public-URL field — it reads as unexplained configuration next to a grid of logos;
surface it where a webhook is actually being registered.

Ship two working presets so both credential-projection paths are exercised by
something real rather than a fixture: one projecting into request headers and one
into a stdio server's environment.

- [x] Done
- Notes:
  - **Encryption at rest.** Sealing lives in the QUERY MODULES
    (`backend/database/crypto` + `sealFor`/`openRow` calls), not in a wrapper
    around the connection — every statement touching a secret column already
    lives in a query module, so SQL parsing bought nothing and could fail
    silently toward plaintext. `auditSecretColumns()` replaces the safety net a
    wrapper would have given and runs at dev startup.
  - **Open defaults.** `mcp_servers.env`/`headers` open to `'{}'` rather than
    `null`, because they are NOT NULL JSON maps and a lost key must not become a
    TypeError inside every engine config builder.
  - **Migrations.** 072 re-encrypts every existing secret, 073 creates the
    tables.
  - **Presets.** Context7 (headers) and Firecrawl (stdio env) — both pure MCP, so
    neither collides with Task 2/3's providers. VERIFY Context7's remote URL and
    `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` header name against their docs at runtime QA.
  - **Projections.** Only the `agent-tools` projector is implemented; the
    capability enum is complete and later surfaces call `registerProjector()`.
    Adoption snapshots the row's env/headers into
    `integration_projections.restore_json` and only rewrites credential-bearing
    fields, never the user's command/args/URL.
  - **Brand marks.** The vendors' own SVGs, keyed by provider id in
    `PROVIDER_ICONS`; a provider without one still falls back to a category
    glyph.
  - **Hub layout.** The toolbar is two fixed rows (controls, then pills) because
    one flex line reflowed differently at every panel width, and everything
    addable lives behind one `Add` button rather than an "Available" list under
    the connected one.
  - **Connect modal.** `ConnectAccountModal` stays mounted and opens by flipping
    `isOpen` — mounting it already-open skips the modal's intro transition — so
    its credential inputs use `value` + `onchange` rather than `bind:`, which
    would point at `undefined` before the seeding effect runs
    (`props_invalid_value`).
  - **Detail view.** Tabbed (Overview / Configuration / Tools / Advanced) with a
    header status strip that owns the enable switch; tool exposure and the
    inspector are inline panels rather than a modal stacked on a modal.
  - **Webhook gateway.** Ships with no subscriber.
  - **Naming.** "Connectors" is retired everywhere it named the section —
    Settings → Profiles still used it, and the README, `backend/mcp/README.md`
    and `backend/engine/docs/artifacts.md` are updated. `backend/mcp/README.md`
    now states where `backend/integrations/` sits relative to it, since MCP is a
    protocol and an integration is a credential, and the two being separate
    modules is otherwise easy to read as duplication.
  - **Status.** Runtime QA of the backend paths is still pending.

# Surfaces

Each entry builds one provider-agnostic capability and the first provider that
proves its shape. If the second provider needs a second panel, the interface is
wrong and fixing it belongs here.

**Task 2 — Issues surface + GitHub.** Highest ROI: an agentic session almost
always ends at a pull request, but the git panel stops at push. Build the panel
every issue-shaped provider plugs into — work items scoped to the current
project, behind one interface covering list, detail, comment, state transition,
and a "start work" action that creates a worktree, names the branch from the item
identifier and seeds the first prompt with the item body and comments. State
transitions stay configurable and off by default. GitHub is the first provider
(OAuth device flow), adding pull requests, review comments and Actions runs, with
two closed loops: open a PR from the current branch with an AI-drafted
description, and stream a failing Actions run's logs back into the chat as
context. Reuse `backend/git/git-service.ts` for local state and never duplicate
remote data into local git commands. Six more providers plug in later.

- [x] Done
- Notes:
  - **Where it lives.** The surface is `More Tools → Issues`, NOT a sixth dock
    panel — adding one touches `PanelId`, the split tree, every layout preset and
    both navigators, and a second entry point for the same work would repeat the
    Notes mistake. The Git panel's More menu gained `Open pull request…`, which
    opens THIS surface with its composer up; many doors, one room.
  - **Adapter, not projector.** Issues registers an ADAPTER
    (`backend/issues/registry.ts`): a projection derives a row on a surface that
    owns a table, and work items are deliberately never copied locally, so there
    was no row to derive — the comment in `projections/types.ts` promising an
    `issues` projector is corrected. That left the hub reporting "Nothing to
    probe yet" forever for a provider with no MCP row, so `health.ts` gained
    `registerAccountProbe(provider, probe)`, which the surface registers and
    which returns null when it has nothing to say (a GitHub account with `issues`
    off still probes through MCP).
  - **Auth.** A TOKEN, not the OAuth device flow sketched above — a device flow
    needs an embedded client id that makes every self-hosted install depend on
    one app we own, its narrowest scope is `repo` (write to EVERY repository the
    user can reach), and `Task 9`'s targets only offer tokens, so the token path
    had to exist anyway. Device flow remains addable later without changing what
    is stored: it is another way to fill the same `token` field. The
    recommendation ENDED UP a CLASSIC token with `repo`, reversing the
    fine-grained guidance shipped first — least privilege is the wrong trade when
    it silently removes access the user already has, since a fine-grained token
    cannot reach a repository you merely collaborate on and that is the common
    case here. Fine-grained still works and is diagnosed, not rejected:
    `tokenKindOf()` reads the prefix, and GitHub's 404 (identical for a missing
    repository and an unpermitted one) is explained rather than repeated — the
    real cause is almost always a fine-grained token scoped to one resource
    owner, which also needs an owner's approval for an organisation's
    repositories. GitHub declares `agent-tools` too (official remote MCP, same
    bearer) but OFF by default.
  - **Schema (migration 074).** `issue_bindings` (which repo, per project per
    account, plus the transition/branch-template config — off by default) and
    `issue_work_links` (item → worktree/session/branch, `ON DELETE SET NULL` so
    applying and deleting a worktree does not erase which issue a branch belongs
    to). Nothing else about a work item is persisted. Binding is DETECTED from
    the git remotes and recorded as detected, always overridable.
  - **Start work.** Kind-aware: an ISSUE gets a new branch from the template, a
    PULL REQUEST gets its head branch fetched and checked out — reviewing code on
    an empty branch is the wrong action — and every branch step fails soft,
    reporting the branch it actually landed on. The prompt differs per mode for
    the same reason. `issues:start-work` timed out at the default 30s mid-clone
    while the server carried on, leaving a worktree nobody was working in; the
    call now carries a 10-minute budget.
  - **Actions logs.** Pull only FAILED jobs via the per-job endpoint (the
    run-level one is a zip of everything) and keep the TAIL, since a CI log's
    head is dependency installation; the redirect to signed storage is followed
    manually so the bearer token is never replayed at a third-party host.
    `CheckLogsModal` shows in-app exactly the bundle the chat prompt is built
    from.
  - **Chat handoff.** Both loops hand TEXT back to the client to send, because
    the chat pipeline is browser-owned and a second injection path would race it.
  - **Reuse over copy.** `diff-budget.ts` was generalised from `--cached` to a
    `DiffScope` (`rangeScope(base, head)` uses three dots, or the description
    would claim work someone else did) rather than copied. `switchToSession()`
    was added to the worktree store and `switchWorktreeContext` refactored onto
    the same barrier, rather than duplicating the swap. `MenuSurface` later
    replaced six hand-rolled popovers: every menu now animates, measures itself
    against the viewport to flip left/right and up/down, and shares one z-index —
    the comment menu used to render beneath the composer.
  - **Access.** Routes are project-access gated, not admin-gated like
    `integrations:*` — they act inside one project, the way `git:push` does.
    Every route takes an optional `projectId` (`ws/issues/context.ts`) so the
    surface is genuinely global: it has its own project picker, no longer follows
    the workspace, and only "start work" relocates you.
  - **Layout.** The More Tools menu is capped at the viewport and scrolls (nine
    entries ran off the top of small screens). The modal is one header row —
    title, account and repository together, with the repository editor as a
    popover — because two stacked strips of chrome cost a quarter of the height
    before an issue was shown. Every control on a row is a fixed h-8/h-9 rather
    than sized by its own padding, since a button sized by text and a `<select>`
    sized by the browser never line up. No action is hover-revealed, because a
    touch screen has no hover and the control simply does not exist there.
    Behaviour is a stacked modal instead of a band that pushed the list down,
    tabs moved into the list column (a full-width strip spent a whole row
    labelling a third-width column), the sidebar is 19rem, and the provider mark
    moved to the footer beside the rate limit — it is identification, not
    navigation. The empty state deep-links to the Connect dialog for the provider
    it needs via `openIntegrationConnect()`, not to the integrations list.
  - **Parity features.** Edit/delete comment (`canModify` computed server-side
    from authorship plus repo write access, because GitHub reports no per-comment
    permission); merge with the method choice restricted to what the repo allows;
    PR sub-tabs Conversation/Commits/Checks/Files changed; assignees; create
    issue; edit title and edit body (the item body renders through `CommentCard`,
    so its menu comes from one component); copy link, copy-as-markdown and
    open-in-browser on every comment; author/label/date-range filters behind one
    button and a state filter including Closed; infinite scroll with
    provider-driven `hasMore`; a `StatePicker` dropdown replacing the native
    `<select>`, which cannot show the current state or a coloured glyph; a
    project-picker filter input; a shared `RefreshButton` that spins, disables
    and holds the spinner a beat so a fast response still reads as an action;
    author names as profile links; a status badge carrying an icon and a category
    colour; "Only mine" renamed "Assigned to me"; the item timeline
    (`/issues/{n}/timeline`, unknown event kinds dropped) on a vertical rail with
    the comments; and a Files-changed view rebuilt as tree + code with an
    IntersectionObserver scroll-spy, a unified/split toggle, copy-path and a
    whole-file viewer through the shared Monaco editor.
  - **Composer.** A markdown composer with a toolbar and Write/Preview — NOT the
    Notes editor, which is contenteditable HTML with its own image store, and
    converting HTML→markdown on the way out is where fidelity goes. IMAGE UPLOAD
    IS NOT POSSIBLE: no REST endpoint attaches a file to a comment (the one
    behind drag-and-drop on github.com is private), and storing bytes in Clopen
    would produce a link broken for everyone else on the thread — so the composer
    offers image-by-URL and says so when a file is dropped.
    `frontend/utils/clipboard.ts` was added because `navigator.clipboard` does
    not exist on a non-secure origin, which is how Clopen is usually reached.
  - **Multi-account.** Now REACHABLE: the account layer always supported
    `(provider, label)`, but Add hid connected providers, which made the connect
    dialog's "only if you connect more than one" a promise the UI refused to keep
    — Add now lists every provider with an "Add another" action and a connected
    count. The inner filter pill "Integrations" is renamed "Accounts" so it no
    longer repeats its own section name.
  - **Bugs found in QA.** A PR's discussion lives on THREE endpoints and only two
    were read: `/pulls/{n}/reviews` carries the summary a reviewer submits, which
    is where review bots put their findings, so a bot's comment was simply never
    shown and looked deleted — review summaries now appear, marked read-only
    (they are edited through the reviews endpoint with different rules). The list
    raced itself: typing a filter and clearing it fired two requests and the
    slower first one could land last, leaving a partial list — every response now
    checks a generation counter before writing. `state=all` rendered a single
    row: `/issues` returns pull requests too and they are filtered out here, so
    on a busy repo the fifty most recently updated items were nearly all closed
    PRs and almost nothing survived — both list paths now go through
    `fillPage()`, which keeps pulling provider pages until the FILTERED page is
    full and reports `nextPage` so load-more resumes where the fill stopped
    rather than at `page + 1`. Relative time was off by one unit (an hour-old
    item read "1 minute ago") because the loop divided and then applied the
    previous unit's name; it is now `frontend/utils/relative-time.ts` with
    explicit thresholds and tests. The filter badge counted Open/Closed/All,
    which is a view rather than a narrowing, so an untouched list claimed one
    filter. The account Name field was read-only when reconfiguring, so a typo
    was permanent — rename was added. Copy-as-markdown copied only a comment's
    first line, and now copies the whole comment as an attributed blockquote.

**Task 3 — Deployments surface + Vercel.** Close the loop after preview. Build
the panel every deploy target plugs into — deployments for the current project
behind one interface covering list, status, build logs and open-preview — with
failing build logs streamed into the chat and the preview URL exposed directly to
the existing preview browser so an agent can drive a real deployed build. Every
action that triggers a build or changes what is live is outward-facing and must
be confirmed explicitly. Vercel is the first provider (API token). Six more
targets plug in later; none of them may add a panel.

- [x] Done
- Notes:
  - **Where it lives.** The surface is `More Tools → Deployments`, NOT a dock
    panel — same reasoning as Task 2, and `capabilities.ts` was corrected from
    the "Deployments panel" it promised.
  - **Adapter, not projector.** Like Issues it registers an ADAPTER
    (`backend/deployments/registry.ts`) plus a `registerAccountProbe`: nothing
    about a deployment is copied locally, so migration 075 creates
    `deploy_bindings` and there is no link table either — unlike an issue, a
    build leaves no worktree behind that outlives the remote record. The binding
    is a sibling of `work_bindings` rather than a generalisation: it needs
    `display_name` (a locator is an opaque `prj_8Qc…`, not a self-describing
    `owner/repo`) and `team_id`.
  - **The team lives on the BINDING, not the account.** One token reaches every
    team, so "which team" is a property of the project you picked; a credential
    field would force connecting the same token twice. Vercel therefore declares
    ONE field.
  - **Detection.** Two passes — `.vercel/project.json`, then a git-remote match
    against each target's connected repo — both recorded as detected and both
    overridable (a monorepo deploying three apps WILL be detected wrong).
  - **Vercel facts absorbed in the adapter,** so no later provider inherits them.
    Versions are per-endpoint (`/v10/projects` to list but `/v9/projects/{id}` to
    read, rollback on `/v1` and promote on `/v10` — two of these were wrong on
    first guess and were checked against the published OpenAPI document).
    `target` is `production` or NULL with no `preview` value, so only production
    filters server-side and everything else fills the page through repeated
    requests — the same bug `state=all` shipped with on the Issues list, fixed
    before shipping here and covered by `list.test.ts`. And LIVE IS NOT A STATE:
    a superseded production build is still `READY` and still `production`, so
    `targets.production.id` off the project is the only honest answer for
    `isCurrent`.
  - **Logs.** They genuinely stream (`follow=1` NDJSON), managed like container
    logs — coalesced flush, bounded ring, per-user cap, stopped when the socket
    closes and at shutdown. `deployment-state` events were being dropped with the
    other non-output events, but they are the only thing that speaks during the
    stretches where a build prints nothing, so they are now forwarded as a
    `phase` — pushed immediately rather than on the flush interval, and only on a
    change — and rendered where the "live" dot used to be. A bare dot cannot be
    told apart from a stall. Rendering goes through the app's own
    `processAnsiCodes`, the path chat tool output already takes, rather than a
    PtyKit terminal: PtyKit is an interactive emulator with a keyboard, cursor
    and resize protocol, and this is read-only text, so it would cost far more
    than the colour is worth and look unlike every other static output in Clopen.
    The log opens itself for every state — hiding the substance of the pane
    behind a "Show the build log" click to save one request was the wrong trade —
    lost its bordered container (a short log looked like an empty card) and trims
    trailing whitespace, since the provider ends its stream with blank lines and
    every streamed chunk appends its own newline.
  - **Outward-facing actions.** Rollback and promote report `pending`, never
    `done`: Vercel accepts the request and moves the aliases afterwards, and
    saying "done" would tell someone their incident was over while the old build
    still served. That `pending` is now finishable — `projectStatus` reads
    `lastAliasRequest.jobStatus`, a bounded poll follows the request to succeeded
    or failed, and a banner says traffic is mid-move; reporting `pending` and
    then never mentioning it again was honest about the moment and useless about
    the outcome. Delete is `DELETE /v13/deployments/{id}`, never offered for what
    is serving production since the provider refuses it. Every action sits behind
    one confirm dialog that names the consequence and the hostname rather than
    asking "are you sure", with the destructive styling reserved for production,
    and the surface exposes NO MCP tool, so no agent can trigger a build.
  - **Pause was added and then REMOVED,** and the reason matters more than the
    removal. It shipped as Pause/Resume (`POST /v1/projects/{id}/pause` and
    `/unpause`), target-level rather than per-build. Vercel's own endpoint
    description says pausing "blocks the active Production Deployment" — it takes
    the SITE DOWN, it does not merely stop future builds — and the confirm dialog
    written for it said the opposite: "anything already live keeps serving". A
    confirm dialog that misstates the consequence is worse than none, because it
    is the thing the user relies on. That the copy was wrong is itself evidence
    the action was not well enough understood to ship from an editor, so it is
    gone rather than reworded. `paused` survives as READ-ONLY state with a
    banner, because when someone pauses in the provider's dashboard nothing else
    explains a list that stopped growing and a site that stopped answering.
    General rule: when a capability's consequence is hard to state accurately,
    that is a reason not to offer it, not a prompt to write better copy.
  - **Creating things, not just listing them.** Redeploy needs an existing
    deployment to copy, so a project that had never been built was a dead end —
    exactly the project someone most wants to get live. `createDeployment` takes
    its `gitSource` from the project's own link, so a GitLab project is not sent
    `type: 'github'`, and note the trap: `name` alone is enough for the API to
    accept the call and CREATES a project when it does not match, so `project` is
    what pins the build to the bound target. `createProject` is prefilled from
    the local project's name and git remote and auto-bound on success, because
    "connect an account" previously left a user with nothing to point at.
    `connectRepository` closes the same kind of dead end for "this project is not
    connected to a git repository", which used to send the user to the provider's
    dashboard — exactly the read-only-window feeling this surface exists to
    remove — and is offered in the deploy dialog prefilled from the local git
    remote. NOTE THE RISK: `POST /v9/projects/{id}/link` is NOT in Vercel's
    published OpenAPI document — `PATCH /v9/projects/{id}` accepts no
    `gitRepository`, and the only documented way to get a connected project is to
    create a new one. It is what `vercel git connect` calls, so the official CLI
    exercises it, but it is the single call in this adapter with no compatibility
    promise; its failure path falls back to the documented create-a-project route
    rather than to a dead end. `deployInfo` is composed in the ROUTE from the
    adapter's answer about the remote project plus the local working tree's
    remote, with `AdapterDeployInfo = Omit<DeployInfo, 'suggestedRepo'>` keeping
    the adapter free of any notion that a Clopen project has a working tree.
  - **The git-connection pre-flight, which took four passes to get right.**
    Connect failed with "You need to add a Login Connection to your GitHub
    account first": Vercel requires the ACCOUNT to hold a git login connection
    before any project can be linked, and that is an OAuth flow on vercel.com
    which NO API token can stand in for — the one prerequisite this surface can
    detect but never satisfy. `repositoryAccess()` asks `GET
    /v1/integrations/git-namespaces` before the button is offered. It first
    answered a BOOLEAN, so the case it could not read had to pretend and returned
    "can connect", which put the button back on screen and let the exact failure
    the check exists to prevent arrive as a toast; it is now three states —
    `ready` enables the button, `blocked` DISABLES it and offers a link out
    instead, `unknown` allows the attempt but says so. `teamId` was also being
    sent to that endpoint, which REJECTS it with a 400 — namespaces belong to the
    signed-in user, not to a team, and the parameter list never included it — so
    every readiness check became an error, surfaced as `unknown`, and let the
    button through: the whole pre-flight was decoration. Locked by a test
    asserting the URL carries no `teamId`. Finally the inference itself was
    wrong: an account with GitHub connected and working was told it had no
    connection, because the check read an EMPTY namespaces list as absence and
    disabled the button on the strength of it — conflating a Vercel "Login
    Connection" (how you sign in) with a GitHub App installation (what lets
    Vercel read repositories), which an account can have one of without the
    other. The rule now: only a POSITIVE match is confident. Owner present and
    unrestricted → `ready`; owner present but RESTRICTED pending an owner's
    approval is named as that, not flattened into a failure; owner absent from a
    NON-EMPTY list → `blocked`, which is informative because the app is installed
    somewhere just not there; an empty list → `unknown`, never blocked, because
    this endpoint's silence can equally mean a token that cannot read
    integrations. A wrapped namespaces response is tolerated rather than read as
    "none", since that would be a confident `blocked` built on a parsing mistake.
    The raw Vercel error is still rewritten to carry the address the user needs,
    because the pre-check can be skipped or go stale. The action URL is the
    GitHub App install page, not the login-connections page, since repository
    access is what is actually missing, and a "Check again" re-reads without
    closing instead of a button that cannot win. `repositoryAccess` is UNBOUND so
    the new-project dialog can ask it too — that form was offering "Connect
    acme/web" ticked by default on accounts that cannot reach acme, the same
    can't-win button in a second place. GENERAL LESSON for later providers: a
    pre-flight check may enable confidently and warn freely, but it must not
    DISABLE on an inference it cannot verify — being wrong there contradicts what
    the user can see on their own screen.
  - **An absent signal is not a negative one** — the same shape of mistake twice.
    `isRollbackCandidate` was read as `raw.isRollbackCandidate === true`, which
    collapsed "the provider says no" and "the provider did not say" into one
    answer, so Roll back never appeared on any listing that omits the field. It
    is now `boolean | null`, and the UI trusts a stated value but falls back to
    what is knowable (a ready production build that is not live) when there is
    none.
  - **Where errors belong.** Provider failures in these dialogs render INSIDE
    them (`InlineError`, which splits URLs out of the message and renders them as
    real links — never `{@html}` on a third-party string) rather than as a toast:
    these messages end in "set it up at <url>", and a toast removes the URL
    before it can be clicked. The general rule for later surfaces: anything the
    user must ACT on belongs in the surface that caused it, and only outcomes
    they merely need to KNOW belong in a toast.
  - **Timeouts.** Wrong in TWO layers, and the inner one was the real culprit —
    the Vercel client aborted at 20s before the 30s WebSocket budget was reached,
    so a link that Vercel completed server-side was reported as a client timeout.
    Reads keep 20s; mutations get 120s, and the slow WS calls get a 3-minute
    budget (a long budget, NOT unbounded — an unbounded call cannot tell "still
    working" from "this socket will never answer").
  - **Preview integration, then its removal.** Open-in-preview needed a new
    generic `openUrlInPreview()`, which creates the tab and lets BrowserPreview's
    existing adopt-a-URL-with-no-session effect launch it — calling
    `launchBrowser` here would open a second backend tab for one link. That
    uncovered a REAL RACE worth knowing about: docks hydrate AFTER the reveal and
    the project switch does not await them, so `await setCurrentProject(...)`
    returns while the preview dock is still rebuilding and would wipe the tab
    just created. Fixed with an exported `whenWorkspaceSettled()` — a no-op when
    no switch is in flight — which every future "relocate then act on a dock"
    path needs. "Open in preview" was later REMOVED at the user's request; Task
    3's spec named that loop explicitly, so this is a deliberate deviation.
    `openUrlInPreview()` went with it rather than shipping dead code, but
    `whenWorkspaceSettled()` stays because the send-log-to-chat relocation still
    needs it.
  - **Chat handoff.** Both loops hand TEXT back to the client to send, for the
    reason Task 2 found.
  - **Deliberately out of scope.** Webhooks (Task 7 is the first consumer, and a
    local Clopen has no public URL to register), env-var management, and
    `agent-tools` — Vercel's MCP server uses its own OAuth, a different audience
    from this REST token, so declaring it would mean projecting a row this
    credential cannot fill.
  - **Shared components.** `MenuSurface`, `RefreshButton` and `ProviderMark` were
    PROMOTED from `components/work/` to `components/common/` rather than
    duplicated; `Button` gained the `danger` variant every destructive confirm in
    the app had been hand-rolling; and spinners moved INSIDE their buttons via a
    shared `ActionButton`, since a spinner beside a row of four actions cannot
    say which one is running.
  - **Dialogs.** The new ones passed no `title` to `Modal`, which renders an
    empty header band containing a stray close button, and added their own
    padding on top of the body padding `Modal` already supplies — the house
    pattern is `<Modal title=… size=…>` with an unpadded child, as `MergeDialog`
    does. Deploy and New Project then became ONE dialog with tabs and the header
    lost its bare "+": two buttons both about deploying made the user choose
    before knowing what either did, so `DeployDialog`/`NewProjectModal` are now
    `DeployPanel`/`NewProjectPanel` inside `DeployModal`, and the tab strip hides
    itself when only one tab applies. The deploy dialog caches its readiness
    answer per (project, account) and shows a shaped skeleton instead of a bare
    spinner — three provider requests on every open was most of why it felt slow
    — and offers the LOCALLY CHECKED-OUT branch alongside the production one,
    since the branch in front of you is at least as likely to be the one you
    meant. The modal is 72rem, not 90vw: the surface never needed the whole
    screen.
  - **List and detail layout.** The auto-refresh and refresh controls moved off
    the environment-chip row (a fourth chip ran into them) onto the search row
    they act upon, the branch filter's glyph is a search icon, and list
    timestamps use a new `shortRelativeTime` — the long form wrapped on a row
    that already carries a state badge, a branch and a commit. Detail gained the
    Domains list (a production build answers on three hostnames and which one you
    want depends on the task), copy buttons for commit and domains, and the
    trigger source; the list column went from 22rem to 17rem, and the newest
    deployment is selected automatically because an empty right-hand pane reads
    as a panel that failed to load. Domains are their own component with an icon
    PER KIND: the project domain follows what is live, the branch alias follows
    the newest build of that branch, and the build URL pins this exact build, so
    rendering all three with one globe made them look like duplicates of one
    address. Facts and domains sit side by side rather than stacked, which was
    leaving half the pane blank while pushing the log down. Detail-pane text
    moved off 11px (fine for labels, below comfortable for content), and the
    footer's empty left half names the provider and account owner, as the Issues
    footer does.
  - **Bugs found in QA.** The scoped and default project listings OVERLAP —
    `/v10/projects` with no `teamId` returns the token's DEFAULT scope, which for
    anyone in a team is that team, so the same project arrived twice and crashed
    the keyed picker. De-duplicating it is not the whole fix: only the
    team-scoped copy carries the `teamId` that every later call needs, so a
    team-scoped entry must always win over an unscoped one, or the picker looks
    right and everything behind it 404s. The fill loop could repeat a row the
    same way when a build landed mid-fetch and shifted the timestamp window. And
    the empty state said "nothing matches this environment filter" with no filter
    set, on a target that had simply never been deployed — it now distinguishes
    never deployed / filtered out / nothing yet, and each says something
    different. Three things declared in the model but never surfaced were also
    closed: the branch filter, the auto-refresh toggle, and the `custom`
    environment chip.
  - **Status.** Nothing here had been run against a real Vercel token when it
    first shipped — the endpoint set, the alias ordering and the log-stream shape
    were verified against documentation and mocked tests only. Every pass
    recorded above came from running it for real, the seventh onwards after a
    successful end-to-end deploy.

**Task 4 — Account-backed database connections + Supabase.** Teach DB Client to
show connections that came from a connected account rather than a hand-typed
form: the projected row is read-only in the connection form, badged with the
account that owns it, and re-projected when that credential rotates. DB Client's
add-connection flow gains a contextual connect entry point so a user already
there never has to go to Settings first. Supabase is the first provider, going
beyond the Postgres connection db-client already gives you: a project-level
integration (management API + project ref) adding tabs inside DB Client for
migrations with a proposed diff applied against a chosen environment, RLS
policies, edge functions, storage buckets and auth users, plus generated
TypeScript types written into the project on demand. Detect an existing local
Supabase CLI project and adopt its config rather than asking the user to retype
it.

**Task 5 — Worktree database branching + Neon.** Pair database branching with the
worktree manager Clopen already has. Creating a worktree optionally creates a
branch on the connected account and injects its connection string into that
worktree's environment; deleting the worktree deletes the branch. This gives
every agent an isolated database to migrate against without touching dev data.
Expose it as a worktree-lifecycle capability other providers implement rather
than as Neon-specific code — Turso lands on the same shape. Opt-in per project
and fail soft: a provider outage must never block worktree creation, and an
orphaned remote branch must be reported rather than silently leaked.

- [ ] Done
- Notes: —

**Task 6 — Notification channels + Telegram.** Build the loop Remote Access has
been missing: when a session needs input or finishes a long run, Clopen sends a
message carrying interactive buttons, and the inbound universal `postback` routes
straight back into that session as user input — approve, reject or reply from a
phone. The channel is a capability surfaced in the existing notification
settings, not a catalogue entry with a panel. Depend on ChatKit **locally**
(`file:../chatkit`, from `~/Codes/MyriaLabs/chatkit`), not from npm: the library
is still maturing, so anything missing or wrong is fixed upstream in the ChatKit
repo as part of this task rather than worked around inside Clopen — but keep
those fixes generic, since ChatKit has other consumers coming and nothing
Clopen-specific may leak into it. Mind the refresh trap: Bun caches a `file:`
dependency by version, not by dist content, so bump ChatKit's version after every
rebuild or Clopen will silently keep the stale build. One backend-owned `ChatKit`
instance, per-account adapters registered at runtime with `chat.add()` /
`chat.remove()`, webhooks mounted through the library's ready-made Elysia handler
from `@myrialabs/chatkit/middleware` behind the `Task 1` gateway (raw body —
signatures are computed over unmodified bytes), and persistent adapters held open
by the long-running backend process. Pass ChatKit a `stateKey` so its
AES-256-GCM auth state is never left unencrypted, scope every message to a single
session id so multi-project users never get crossed wires, and surface
`chat.health()` per account. Telegram ships first: webhook, no ban risk, simplest
pairing.

# Providers

Each entry registers with `Task 1` and plugs into a surface that already exists.
None of them may add a panel.

**Task 7 — Sentry.** The most distinctive loop Clopen can own, and the first
consumer of the `Task 1` webhook gateway: an issue arrives inbound, its stack
trace, breadcrumbs and release metadata become session context, the agent
reproduces it with the existing browser-automation tools, fixes it, and opens a
PR referencing the issue. Register the inbound handler and expose issues through
the `Task 2` interface so "start a session from this issue" is the action that
surface already provides. This is also where the hook URL becomes real, so
surface public-URL configuration here, in the place a user is registering a
webhook — and warn plainly when the resolved origin comes from a quick tunnel,
whose hostname changes on every restart.

- Notes: —

**Task 8 — Linear.** Make task tracking a *trigger into* Clopen rather than a
place to report out. An assigned-issues list through the `Task 2` interface, with
issue-to-worktree already provided by that surface, and state transitions on
branch push and PR open — configurable and off by default. OAuth.

- [ ] Done
- Notes: —

**Task 9 — GitLab, Gitea and Forgejo.** The proof that the GitHub work
generalises: merge requests, issues and pipeline status behind the same
issue-provider interface, with a user-supplied base URL so self-hosted instances
work. Gitea and Forgejo matter because Clopen's audience skews toward
self-hosting; support personal access tokens and degrade gracefully when an
instance lacks newer API endpoints. If any of the three needs bespoke panel code,
`Task 2`'s interface is wrong and that is what to fix.

- [ ] Done
- Notes: —

**Task 10 — Jira and PostHog.** Jira is the enterprise counterpart to Linear
behind the same interface: assigned issues, issue-to-worktree, status transitions
on push, both Cloud and Data Center base URLs, and expect JQL to be the only
reliable way to scope a query. PostHog feeds product reality into the same
surface: funnels, error events and session replays for the current project, where
an issue found in a replay becomes a session prompt with the reproduction steps
attached. Read-only to start; writing feature flags can come later.

- [ ] Done
- Notes: —

**Task 11 — Cloudflare.** One account feeding three surfaces, which is why it is
its own entry: D1 as a first-class DB Client connection, Workers and Pages
deployment status and log tailing through the `Task 3` surface, and the tunnel
credentials Clopen already depends on. Keep tunnel credentials and account API
tokens strictly separate in the account store — they authorise different things
and must not be interchangeable.

- [ ] Done
- Notes: —

**Task 12 — Deploy targets: Coolify/Dokploy, Railway, Fly.io, Netlify, Render.**
Five providers behind the `Task 3` interface, each supplying applications,
deployments and log streams. Coolify and Dokploy take a user-supplied instance
URL and API key and match Clopen's VPS story better than any managed PaaS; the
other three take an API token. Read-only first, with any action that triggers a
build confirmed explicitly. No custom UI for any of them.

- [ ] Done
- Notes: —

**Task 13 — Database targets: Turso, Upstash, PlanetScale, MongoDB Atlas.** Four
providers behind the `Task 4` interface. Turso is a near-free win given Clopen is
already SQLite-native: token auth plus embedded-replica awareness, reusing the
existing sqlite driver's query layer wherever the dialect matches, and
per-worktree branches through `Task 5`. Upstash adds serverless Redis (and
optionally QStash) with REST-token auth so the existing redis explorer works
without a TCP connection. PlanetScale uses the existing mysql driver with the
required TLS settings. MongoDB Atlas reuses the mongodb driver with SRV
connection strings and IP-allowlist guidance in the connect dialog.

- [ ] Done
- Notes: —

**Task 14 — Chat channels: Discord, Slack, WhatsApp.** Three more channels
through the `Task 6` code path, which is the point — if any of them needs
platform-specific handling inside Clopen, the gap belongs in ChatKit. Discord and
Slack (Socket Mode) come nearly free. WhatsApp via Baileys ships last, off by
default, with its ban-risk warning shown in the connect dialog.

# Catalogue

Curated MCP presets: icon, category, credential shape and a tested default
prompt, registered with `Task 1` and exposing agent tools only. If one of them
starts needing custom code or a panel, promote it to a `Providers` entry instead.

**Task 15 — Research and documentation: Context7, Exa, Firecrawl.** Context7 for
up-to-date library documentation, one of the highest daily-value tools for a
coding agent — ship it enabled by default in the suggested starter set. Exa for
semantic web and code search when the agent needs research beyond documentation;
keep it distinct from Context7 in the catalogue copy so users understand when to
use which. Firecrawl for crawling and converting live sites into clean markdown,
useful for migration and scraping work, pairing with the existing browser
automation rather than replacing it.

- [ ] Done
- Notes: —

**Task 16 — Design and knowledge sources: Figma, Notion.** Figma installs the
official Dev Mode MCP server plus a thin surface listing selected frames and
exposing design tokens to the session, so frontend work starts from real design
data — no bespoke API client, the value is the preset plus a good default prompt.
Notion is a documentation and spec source: connect a workspace, let the user pick
pages or databases to expose as session context, and allow the agent to write
session summaries back to a chosen page, with write access opt-in per page.

- [ ] Done
- Notes: —

**Task 17 — Developer services: Stripe, Resend, Twilio.** Stripe for payment-flow
work, scoped to test-mode keys by default and refusing to store live keys without
an explicit confirmation in the connect dialog. Resend for transactional email so
agents can send and inspect test messages while building signup and notification
flows, domain and API-key auth only. Twilio for SMS and voice testing during auth
or notification work, with sandbox credentials encouraged in the connect copy.

- [ ] Done
- Notes: —

**Task 18 — Inspection presets: Grafana, Axiom, Better Stack, Docker Hub, GHCR,
Firebase.** Read-only windows into external systems, so a production signal can
be pulled into a session without leaving Clopen. Grafana queries dashboards and
logs against a user-supplied instance with a base URL and service-account token.
Axiom and Better Stack query logs; one category, two entries, same shape.
Docker Hub and GHCR inspect images and tags with token auth, composing with the
existing containers surface. Firebase inspects Firestore and auth for users
migrating off or maintaining Firebase apps; service-account JSON is the
credential shape, stored through the account layer and never written to disk.

- [ ] Done
- Notes: —

**Task 19 — Secrets managers: 1Password, Doppler, Infisical.** Presets so project
environment variables can be pulled at session start instead of being pasted into
Clopen. This also strengthens `Task 1` by making Clopen a *consumer* of secrets
rather than their permanent home, which is the strongest available answer to
"why is my token in your database".
