	/**
	 * The graph itself — a calm constellation rather than a diagram.
	 *
	 * ── Why hover state is NOT `$state` ────────────────────────────────────────
	 * Sigma calls its node/edge reducers synchronously from inside `setGraph()` and
	 * `refresh()`. If those reducers read reactive state, Svelte records it as a
	 * dependency of whatever effect triggered the render — so hovering a node made
	 * the graph-building effect re-run, rebuilding the graph, restarting the layout
	 * and resetting the camera. Everything a reducer touches therefore lives in a
	 * plain variable. The rule to keep: a reducer must never read a rune.
	 *
	 * ── Why it no longer computes a layout ────────────────────────────────────
	 * It used to run ForceAtlas2 on every open — several hundred iterations to
	 * arrive at the same arrangement it arrived at last time, thrown away when the
	 * modal closed. That was the bulk of what made opening the modal stutter: the
	 * open animation is two hundred milliseconds of this thread, and the build plus
	 * the first layout batches landed inside it.
	 *
	 * Positions now arrive with the data, computed once in the background (see
	 * `backend/memory/layout.ts`). The simulation still exists here, but only for
	 * nodes that have no position yet — memories written since the last pass — and
	 * it is a short settle of a handful of arrivals rather than a solve of
	 * everything.
	 *
	 * ── Two resolutions ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	 * Past a render budget the server merges memories that share a cell of the
	 * layout grid into one mark, so what is drawn stays bounded however much
	 * memory accumulates — but only where the dots would have overlapped anyway,
	 * and a cell holding one memory still arrives as that memory. Both shapes are
	 * normalised into `DrawNode` here, because everything below this — sizing,
	 * colouring, emphasis, hover — is the same work either way.
	 *
	 * ── Why it looks the way it does ──────────────────────────────────────────
	 * Quiet at rest, informative on contact. Small nodes and hairline edges, so the
	 * structure is carried by the arrangement rather than by the ink; unfocused
	 * nodes dim but stay visible rather than vanishing; and NOTHING is labelled
	 * until it is pointed at, at either resolution. Captions were tried for the
	 * merged marks on the theory that a crowd needs naming, and they reproduced the
	 * same overlapping text layer over a picture whose entire value is its shape.

	 * animation forces it to reprocess the scene: rebuild the extent, the
	 * normalization and the program indexation for every element. That is the
	 * expensive shape this whole change exists to stop paying.
	 *
	 * `size` is neither. It is not in sigma's layout-impacting set, so the frames
	 * go through the same partial repaint that hovering already uses — the cost is
	 * one reducer pass over what is drawn, which is bounded by the render budget
