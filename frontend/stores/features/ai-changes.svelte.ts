/**
 * AI Changes Store
 *
 * What the current chat changed on disk, turn by turn. Drives the violet dot in
 * Files and Git, the AI gutter in the editor, and the Changes tab of the
 * checkpoint modal — one store so those three can never tell different stories.
 *
 * The data comes from checkpoint snapshots, NOT from Edit/Write tool calls.
 * Reading the transcript meant a change only counted when it arrived as a tool
 * the frontend recognised, which silently missed everything written through
 * Bash, apply_patch, a notebook edit, a formatter, or a sub-agent (whose tool
 * inputs are stripped on the wire). A snapshot is a gitignore-aware disk diff,
 * so it sees the result regardless of how it was produced — including a tool
 * that does not exist yet.
 *
 * The honest reading of a turn's file list is "changed while this turn ran",
 * which can include a file the user saved themselves mid-turn. Every label in
 * the UI says it that way rather than claiming authorship.
 *
 * Scope is the chat session being viewed: these markers exist to explain what
 * this conversation did, and they are cleared when the conversation changes.
