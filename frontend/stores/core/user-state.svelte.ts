/**
 * User Server State — single loader for `user:restore-state`.
 *
 * Every per-user value the app persists (settings, last view, project order,
 * unread sessions, todo panel, command usage) arrives in one round trip. This
 * module owns that call so there is exactly one place that decides whether the
 * client actually holds the user's saved state.
 *
 * That distinction matters: stores here persist by sending their whole object
 * back to the server, so acting on defaults that were never replaced by the
 * server's copy silently overwrites the real one. Callers must therefore treat
 * `null` as "not loaded" and refuse to save — see `settings.svelte.ts`.
 *
 * The load is single-flight and cached on success; a failure is not cached, so
 * the next caller retries.
