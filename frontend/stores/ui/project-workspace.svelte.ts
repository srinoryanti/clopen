/**
 * Project Workspace Coordinator
 *
 * Owns the per-project workspace blob (one JSON document per project, persisted
 * server-side via `workspace:get/save-state`) and orchestrates a single,
 * coordinated transition when the active project changes.
 *
 * Each dock (layout, git, preview, terminal, chat, …) registers a
 * `DockController` describing how to:
 *   - clear()    tear down its in-memory view data so the previous project's
 *                content can never flash through during a switch
 *   - snapshot() produce its serializable slice of the active project's blob
 *   - restore()  apply a restored slice before the new project is revealed
 *   - load()     kick async data loading; this runs AFTER the reveal, behind the
 *                dock's panel skeleton, so one slow dock can't hold up the rest
 *
 * The transition is split in two on purpose. The switch barrier covers only the
 * structural swap — the phase where any pixel on screen would belong to the
 * previous project. Data loading happens after, per panel, so switch latency is
 * bounded by one round trip rather than the sum of every subsystem's load.
 *
 * The coordinator is intentionally dependency-light: it never imports the dock
 * modules. Docks call `registerDock()` at module load and hand the coordinator
 * plain function references, so there are no import cycles.

 * Activate a project's workspace with a single coordinated transition.

 *   2. raise the switch barrier (panels show a uniform "Loading…")
 *   3. clear() every dock so no stale data can flash through
 *   4. fetch the new project's blob and restore() every dock's slice
 *   4b. run `onAfterRestore` (see below)
 *   5. START every dock's load() WITHOUT awaiting it, each registered against
 *      its panel so that panel renders a skeleton until its data lands
 *   6. drop the barrier — the workspace is revealed as soon as it is structurally
 *      correct, not once every byte has arrived
 *
 * Step 5 used to await all loads under the barrier. That made a switch cost the
 * sum of every dock's slowest round-trip with the whole workspace blanked, which
 * on a large project read as "switching projects is very slow". Loading behind
 * per-panel skeletons costs the same wall-clock but the workspace is usable —
 * and correct — almost immediately, and a slow dock only holds up its own panel.
 *
 * `onAfterRestore` runs synchronously between the dock restore loop (4) and the
 * load phase (5) — i.e. in the SAME synchronous block as `applyLayoutSlice`,
 * which the `layout` dock's restore() just ran. The caller uses it to publish
 * the new `projectState.currentProject`, so Svelte batches the layout swap and
 * the current-project change into one flush: panels that remount on the layout
 * swap mount ONCE, already pointing at the new project, with their dock
 * view-state already restored. Setting the current project any later (after the
 * await below) lets the layout swap flush alone first — remounting live panels
 * against the OLD project, which then race a reload and can leave them blank
 * until a full refresh. (The refresh path has no such gap: it activates the
 * workspace behind the loading screen before any panel mounts.)
 *
 * Pass `null` to deactivate (e.g. when no project is selected).
