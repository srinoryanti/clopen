All-in-one workspace for AI coding agents — Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Copilot, Qwen Code, Pi, Cline, and Cursor. Chat, terminal, git, browser preview, database client, and real-time collaboration — plus Skills, Subagents, Commands, and MCP connectors to extend every engine.

## Features

A complete development environment designed around AI-assisted workflows, built to disappear into the background and just work.

- **Multi-Engine Support** — Switch between Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Qwen Code, Pi, Cline, and Cursor as your AI engine, per session
- **Multi-Account Per Engine** — Manage multiple accounts per engine (personal, work, or team) and switch between them instantly per chat session
- **Reasoning Effort Control** — Dial a model's thinking level right from the chat input, using that engine's own levels. Set a default per model in Settings, and the choice is remembered and synced with everyone in the session
- **Integrated Terminal** — Multi-tab xterm.js terminal with full keyboard control and complete ANSI/VT support, right inside your workspace
- **Full Git Management** — Stage, commit, branch, push, pull, stash, log, and resolve conflicts, all from a clean UI
- **Real Browser Preview** — A live browser preview streams directly into your workspace. Interact with your app manually, or let the AI drive: clicking, typing, and scrolling for autonomous visual testing
- **Database Client** — Connect to PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and Redis. Browse schemas, run queries, and inspect data, with optional SSH tunneling for databases behind a bastion
- **Git-Like Checkpoints** — Multi-branch undo/redo with full file snapshots. Roll back to any point in your AI conversation without touching your actual git history
- **Real-Time Collaboration** — See who's working on which project, and collaborate live in the same codebase
- **Monaco File Editor** — VS Code's editor right in the browser. Full syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and live file watching, beside your AI chat
- **Cloudflare Tunnel** — One-click public HTTPS URL for your local dev server. Built-in QR code for instant mobile access. Share your work without deploying
- **Integrations** — Connect a third-party account once and every engine and project can use it. Credentials are sealed at rest with AES-256-GCM. Includes the full MCP surface: browse the official Model Context Protocol registry, connect with OAuth or custom env/headers, control tool exposure per engine, and sync every connector across all your AI engines
- **Skills, Commands & Subagents** — Build reusable Skills, slash Commands, delegated Subagents, shared Instructions, and tool Permissions or Profiles once, synced automatically across every engine
- **Flexible Authentication** — No Login or With Login mode with admin/member roles, invite links, rate-limited login, and CLI token recovery
- **Stack** — Install AI engines, Git, Chrome, and Cloudflared (for Public Tunnel) from a one-click admin panel. Engines install on demand into a clopen-managed directory (`~/.clopen/stack/engines`) — isolated from your global setup, no PATH pollution
- **Background Processing** — Chat, terminal, and other processes continue running even when you close the browser — come back later and pick up where you left off
- **Works on Any Device** — Fully responsive across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile. Open your workspace from any device and continue exactly where you left off

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Bun.js](https://bun.sh/) v1.2.12+
- At least one supported AI engine — [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli), [Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code), [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), or [Cursor](https://cursor.com). All install on demand from **Settings → Stack** after first launch (nothing is bundled into the clopen install), then sign in from **Settings → Engines**

### Installation

```bash
bun add -g @myrialabs/clopen
```

### Update

```bash
clopen update
```

Or manually via Bun:

```bash
bun add -g @myrialabs/clopen
```

You can also update from the **Settings → Maintenance → Updates** section in the web UI.

### Usage

```bash
clopen
```

Starts the server on `http://localhost:9141`.

### First-Time Setup

On first launch, a setup wizard guides you through:

1. **Authentication mode** — Choose between **No Login** (no authentication required, ideal for personal/local use) or **With Login** (login with Personal Access Token, supports team collaboration)
2. **Admin account** — If With Login mode is selected, create your admin account and save the generated PAT
3. **Stack** — Install Git, Chrome, Cloudflared, and any AI engine you don't have yet — straight from the wizard, no terminal needed
4. **AI Engines** — Check installation status for every engine and sign in to the ones you'll use. An engine that isn't installed yet links straight back to the Stack step
5. **Preferences** — Set dark mode, font size, sound notifications, and message layout (Classic cards or Compact lines)

You can change the authentication mode anytime in **Settings → Security → Authentication**.

To invite team members (With Login mode), go to **Settings → Team → Invite** and generate an invite link (valid for 15 minutes).

If you lose your admin token:

```bash
clopen reset-pat
```

This regenerates and displays a new admin PAT.

## Contributing

Clopen is open source and contributions are welcome! Whether it's a bug fix, new feature, or improvement to docs — feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/myrialabs/clopen.git
cd clopen
bun install
bun run dev     # Start development server
bun run check   # Type checking
```

When running in development mode, Clopen uses `~/.clopen-dev` instead of `~/.clopen`, keeping dev data separate from any production instance.

Each AI engine's config/state (credentials, sessions, logs) is isolated under `~/.clopen/engine/<engine>/user/` rather than the engine's global location (`~/.codex`, `~/.copilot`, `~/.qwen`, the OpenCode XDG dirs), so Clopen never mixes with — or disturbs — your own standalone CLI usage.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines and [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for architectural decisions.

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Runtime | Bun.js |
| Frontend | Svelte 5 (runes) + Vite |
| Backend | Elysia + WebSocket |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Database | SQLite with migrations |
| Terminal | bun-pty |
| AI Engines | Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Copilot, Qwen Code, Pi, Cline, Cursor |
| DB Client | Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis (+ SSH tunnel) |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port 9141 Already in Use

```bash
clopen --port 9145
```

Or kill the existing process:
```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
lsof -ti:9141 | xargs kill -9

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :9141
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```
